Not sleeping feels like a disaster. But in smaller doses, insomnia does not need a cure. It's there for a reason; it's doing work for us. - and we should learn to let it take its course. Crucial things we need to think about are seeking their chance to bubble into consciousness. This insomnia is a form of revenge for all the many ideas we pushed away, or could not entertain in the day - but that matter intensely to our self-understanding and development. We have been busy for too long; we have been running on empty. But at night, we can return to a bigger duty: to ourselves. What we think about now would sound weird to so many people - my partner, my mother, my friend, my boss, my child. These people need us to be a certain way. We don't want to let them down. But their expectations choke off important aspects of who we are. Yet now, it is just us and the universe - and for a time, we can take on a little of its boundlessness. With a pad of paper and a pen, and a little bedsight light on, we can dare to investigate the big questions that we normally push away and that manifest themselves just as background anxieties. We start to untangle our knotted feelings and ideas. Things will have to change. There are exciting plans afoot too. Perhaps we can chuck it in, and start anew; perhaps it’s time for that idea we've had for so long. Night offers us safety from the scepticism of sensible others. It allows us time to get ourselves together. We want to arrive, eventually, at a feasible, defensible strategy. But we can start with thoughts, schemes that look unimpressive, weird",

Insomnia is when you consistently have difficulties either falling asleep, difficulties staying asleep or you just don’t feel refreshed or restored by your sleep the next day. Now, when sleep becomes difficult, there are many things that people understandably turn to for help, but not all of them work especially well. For instance alcohol and THC, which is the psychoactive component of cannabis, are all popular options. However, both THC and alcohol will ultimately make your insomnia and your sleep difficulties worse, rather than better. Even melatonin will only increase your sleep quality, or what we call your sleep efficiency, by just a few percent. Thankfully, however, there is a much more effective, drug-free approach called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBTI for short. And by working with a clinician for several weeks -- which you can do online, by the way -- the therapy helps change your habits, your beliefs and your general stress around this thing called sleep. And there are now many studies that have shown CBTI to be just as effective as sleeping pills in the short term. Yet CBTI has no negative side effects, unlike sleeping pills. In addition, after you stop  working with your therapist, the sleep benefits can last for years later. CBTI is now, in fact, so powerful that it is our first-line recommended treatment for insomnia, and it allows you to regain your confidence in the ability to sleep well each and every night.",

So you lay there, look at the clock, get upset because you have to get up in a few hours, you drink this, you read that, you flip around so your head is where your feet normally are and so on. And...nothing works. But this will... I'm going to show you a special breathing exercise that you can do, in bed, it's quiet, you won't wake anyone up, no one will even know you're doing it and you'll forget you're doing it because you'll fall asleep. Here's how it goes. When you breath in, you're going to make a sound in your head. When you breath out, you're going to make a different sound in your head. Whether you breath from your nose or mouth or both makes no difference. And the sounds you're going to make...in your head, not out loud...will be SAAAAA and OOOOOOOM. Uh-oh, is this some mystical stuff that's way out there? Nope. The sounds are actually white noise...which is a constant noise that naturally relaxes human beings. And it just so happens, that in the English language, vowels create white noise. A...E...I...O...U. So you can really use any vowel or any words or letters that drag out with a vowel at the end. But we're going to use SAAAAA and OOOOOM in this video. To start, we're going to use 3 focus breaths. These are 3 breaths that are deeper than normal breaths, but not as deep as a deep breath. Like this... Then we're going to start",

And when we breath out, in our mind, we're going to say OOOOOOmmm. What's important here is the rhythem...that it's consistant. SAAAA, OOOOOOm. Should you do this for a certain length of time or should you do this X number of times? Nope. In fact, if you try to count while doing this, you're going to lose track of the number pretty quickly. You're simply going to keep doing this until you screw up, which means you're about to fall asleep because you're not really conscious anymore...or you'll fall asleep and won't even remember you were doing this. Sorry if you were expecting someting more complex, but simple always works best.

Sleep for three or four hours at a time that corresponds to a normal sleep or wake time in the time zone you’re leaving, then stay awake for a while, and then sleep four more hours at a time that corresponds to a normal wake time at your destination. For example, suppose you’re flying from Los Angeles to London, leaving at 4 p.m. PST and arriving at 11 a.m. GMT. You would sleep from 3 to 7 a.m. the night before your flight. After getting on your flight, you would wait four more hours and then sleep for four hours, from 4 to 8 a.m. London time. Upon waking you’d have some caffeine to help reset your internal clock. Three hours later you would arrive at your destination, relatively well-rested because you would have had eight hours of sleep in the past day, the second half of which would have been on London time. The next day you’d be completely jet lag–free. Cause 10: GABA Deficiency   Can cause: Sleep maintenance and early awakening insomnia  Because GABA is the main hormone responsible for sleep maintenance, some sleep issues may be as simple as your brain not producing enough of it. This issue can sometimes be fixed through improved diet or lifestyle, but if that fails, you can address it more directly with supplementation.",

But that guideline is very dependent on your body weight, metabolism, and even what you ate that day. In other words, you should be giving yourself a pretty wide margin of error.

Early Awakening Insomnia  The final type of insomnia is the one that leads you to wake up too early in the morning, perhaps an hour or two ahead of your planned wake time. Early awakening insomnia somewhat resembles sleep maintenance insomnia; the main difference is that in this case, you wake up late enough that it’s impractical to get back to sleep. This is sometimes also called terminal insomnia, since it comes at the end of the night, but that name isn’t commonly used since it sounds misleadingly dire. Early awakening puts you between a rock and a hard place. Because you’ve slept most of the night, your brain is starting to produce cortisol, which starts to wake you up. And since sleep occurs in roughly 90-minute cycles, you may not have time to get back to sleep and actually get through another full cycle. Insomnia can have many, many different causes.

Sleep is the body’s way of restoring itself after each day’s effort; if you don’t make any kind of effort, sleep becomes less vital and more elusive. The greatest sleep aid is physical exercise (fresh air helps too!). Do you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day? A set routine habituates the body’s sleep/wake cycle. If you experience several sleepless nights, go talk to your doctor about possibly getting a sleep study done.

It’s a scene far too familiar for many of us: You, lying in bed, wide awake, tossing and turning, painfully aware of the hours ticking by. The more time passes, the more stressed you feel that you’re still not asleep and about how tired you’ll feel the next day.

When you’re up in the middle of the night, it might feel like you’re the only living soul still awake—but you’re not. Nearly a quarter of American adults report a problem sleeping. The reasons range from conditions that interfere with breathing, causing sleep apnea, snoring and restless sleep, to nervous tension in the body and unconscious fears that arise in slumber.

More than 30% of people struggle with occasional insomnia, and 10% suffer from a chronic condition. If we’re all so tired, why can’t we just go to sleep? The body and mind need one thing in order to fall asleep and stay asleep: relaxation. Deep relaxation. Anything that interferes with that state keeps us awake. Often, restlessness starts in our heads. When we’re busy or worried, it can be difficult to “turn off” the thinking brain enough to allow the body’s natural relaxation response to kick in.",

Here are strategies to address those problems and overcome insomnia.  1. Understanding Sleep Patterns. A great deal of the worry associated with insomnia may be related to our misconceptions about sleep timing. Many of us adhere to the 8-hours-of-uninterrupted-sleep notion. This is the belief that sleeping straight through for 8 hours is “normal.” However, sleep research suggests that the normal pattern may be what is called “segmented sleep.” This is the idea that our natural rhythm is to sleep for 3-4 hours, followed by a 1-2 hour awake period, and a second 2-4 hour sleep. Historical evidence suggests that segmented sleep was once common, and our ancestors used the mid-night waking period to visit with neighbors, have a snack, or have sex.

We may worry about our lack of uninterrupted sleep, or too few hours of sleep per night, and this anxiety often keeps us awake. By cognitive reframing—thinking differently about our sleep patterns—we may alleviate some of our insomnia. An obvious strategy is to assure ourselves that segmented sleep is ok, and a few nights of poor sleep will not lead to lasting damage.  3. Benign Reflection. Wakefulness, right after we hit the sack or in the middle of the night, offers an opportunity to put negative thinking on hold, count our blessings, and reflect on the many positive things in our lives.",
