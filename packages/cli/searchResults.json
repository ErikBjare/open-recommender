    "description": "In our coaching program helping people with adrenal fatigue, one of the most frequent complaints is that they cannot fall asleep. But those people who do fall asleep have a tendency to wake up multiple times in the evening after maybe 2 hours sleeping or 3 hours sleeping and they are not able to fall back to sleep anymore, or they can but it takes some time.\n \n https://www.drlamcoaching.com/blog/stop-waking-up-at-3-am-every-night-sleep-more-function-better/\n \n This is Dr.Lam, founder of DrLam.com. Now this phenomena is called sleep maintenance insomnia, or what we call SMI. So typically a person goes to sleep, and then after 2-3 hours wake up. Sometimes waking up with night sweats, sometimes with heart pounding, sometimes with heart palpitations, heart pounding I talked about earlier and sometimes with racing dreams, and it's very hard to go back to sleep. Sometimes it takes 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and then when they go back to sleep, there's frequent awakening again.\n \n Now, what are the physiological reasons for this to happen? There are several reasons. Metabolically, if your blood sugar is low in the middle of the night, this could happen. Number 2, if you have a sympathetic system that is on overdrive, causing the body to be in a fight or flight response, then the norepinephrine as well as the epinephrine that is released as a result of this HPA axis activation can lead to the body being in an alert state.\n \n Now, this alert state usually is something that carries on from the day. So most of these people will have difficulty falling asleep to begin with. But eventually they do fall asleep because the body gets so overwhelmingly tired. But after sleeping for a couple of hours, because the underlying neurological endocrine hormones are still being released and still activated, then the body eventually wakes up. And then when you wake up, sometimes as I said, you have heart pounding. This reflects the norepinephrine as well as the epinephrine effect from the sympathetic effect. This is called again sleep maintenance insomnia.\n \n So if you have frequent awakening and you don't have structural problems like lung or airway obstructions that your doctor has cleared you from. The question you have to ask is why this happens. Usually a person goes into sleep and goes through various stages and eventually comes out in daytime and early morning as cortisol rises. So another reason for the sleep maintenance insomnia is a cortisol curve that is imbalanced. Sometimes we have to take the cortisol level in the middle of the night just to see how biologically the rhythm is disrupted.\n \n Most people think of sleep as an independent event that happena from let's say 10'o'clock in the evening to 6 or 7'o'clock in the morning. But that is a concept that needs to be modified. If you don't have a biological rhythm that is well balanced throughout the day, then it's going to have the flow through any imbalances. Dysregulations will flow through into the night and that is what one of the things you're going to have to look into as far as SMI.\n \n Having SMI therefore is a symptom of adrenal fatigue and SMI is an opportunity for us to look into the reasons as to why you maybe having this problem and how you can trace it to the root level, especially with regards to biological rhythma. Once you understand this concept, then you will understand that by restoring the biological rhythm to its normal circadian balance, then oftentimes the SMI will resolve. Similarly, if the SMI is reset, it could be due to metabolic reasons, and if you're able to overcome the metabolic issues, then the SMI will eventually go away or reduce. So SMI is an important symptom. It's a symptom that allows us to investigate further and I hope you can understand this concept.\n \n-----\nCould you have Adrenal Fatigue?
