        "Experimenting with creating a AI journalling assistant rn. Getting the RAG/chat memory right is the most important part. Here's the approach that got the best results so far:\n\n- take each paragraph\n- add metadata using gpt (emotions mentioned, people mentioned, topics mentioned)\n- for each theme (emotion/topic/person) take all paragraphs mentioning that theme and summarise using GPT\n- when writing a new journal entry, extract themes (emotions/topics/people), then include all the summaries for those themes and get the AI to question you\n\nIt feels way better than naive RAG. Obviously it's more work, more expensive and you end up having to keep doing LLM calls to update the summaries over time, but I think it's worth it.",
