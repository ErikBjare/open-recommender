Lastly, the user also displays an interest in software development, producing 'Incremental Everything,' a plugin for @rem_note, an SRS tool that incorporates incremental reading and writing functionality. @experilearning is deeply immersed in the world of language model learning (LLM), currently working on an open-source LLM-powered YouTube video recommendation system called 'Open Recommender'. They frequently share updates about the project's progress and their plans for improving its abilities. Their focus is on refining the system to improve the relevancy of recommendations, aiming to reach 80% relevancy. They also work on prompt engineering, creating a 'prompt-iteration-assistant' library to simplify this process. Other interests include incremental reading, with an emphasis on a plugin for remnote, and a keen interest in Spaced Repetition Systems exemplified in their discussions about making spaced repetition reviews more enjoyable. They also evoke an interest in crowd-sourced initiatives, such as advocating a 'golden age of people taking control of their own feeds'. @experilearning demonstrates a strong interest and expertise in the specifics of handling large language models (LLMs) and building Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) applications with a clear focus on the open-source community. He has a fascination with the practical application of artificial intelligence technology, evidenced by his development of an application, 'Open Recommender', which uses a user's Twitter data to recommend YouTube videos. His interest in customized content feeds is evident in his liking of a tweet advocating for user control over feeds. Moreover, he has experience in debugging scripts and assessing their accuracy, such as the 'appraiseTranscript' prompt used to distinguish between quality content and SEO spam based on video transcripts. @experilearning's tweets showcase a strong interest in Life-Long Learning Machine (LLM) agents, open source programming, artificial intelligence, and recommender systems. They have been actively working on a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) app called RemNote and an open source project named Open Recommender, a recommendation system aimed at generating YouTube video suggestions based on Twitter data. They've also shared their work routine and efforts in dealing with code debugging and iterating, often referencing technical terms and platforms like GitHub. Tech innovation, specifically in France, seems to pique their interest, as they've retweeted and liked content praising French advancements in AI research and social network innovation. The user 'experilearning' is deeply interested in AI, robotics and advanced technology. They actively engage in discussions about new tech development and its implications and express interest in books like The Three Body Problem. They also frequently share their thoughts on personalized content recommendations and LLM (Lifelong Learning Machines) agents and anticipate a resurgence in RSS reader-style internet consumption powered by cheaper LLMs. Another evident fascination is about OpenAI and related discussions, showcasing their interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning and the ethics surrounding it. This user also enjoys exploring YouTube content based on interest-based queries and maintains an active interest in creating a YouTube video recommender system that can predict a user's current interests and offer timeless content. Moreover, they seem to be developing an SRS (Spaced Repetition Software) app called 'rem_note' which suggests an interest in education and learning tools. They usually interact with other users on the platform regarding technical queries and welcome discussions about their work and projects. @experilearning is interested in Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS), Open Recommender Systems, Language Model Learning (LLM) Agents and is developing RemNote, an SRS app. They discuss about open-source systems, GitHub workflows, project enhancement strategies, and AI applications like in art/music. Organizes tech meetups in Oxford. Also speaks about AI safety, engineering, programming, TypeScript, Zod, AI integrative programming, cognitive structures, problem-solving using concept mapping methods.
