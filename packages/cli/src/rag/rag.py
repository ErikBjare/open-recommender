                "content": " With all the excitement around ChatGPT, it's easy to lose sight of the unique risks of generative AI. Large language models, a form of generative AI, are really good at helping people who struggle with writing English prose. It can help them unlock the written word at low cost and sound like a native speaker. But because they're so good at generating the next syntactically correct word, large language models may give a false impression that they possess actual understanding or meaning. The results can include a flagrantly false narrative directly as a result of its calculated predictions versus a true understanding. So ask yourself: What is the cost of using an AI that could spread misinformation? What is the cost to your brand, your business, individuals or society? Could your large language model be hijacked by a bad actor? Let me explain how you can reduce your risk. It falls into four areas: Hallucinations, Bias, Consent, and Security. As I present each risk, I'll also call out the strategies you can use to mitigate these risks. You ready? Let's start with the falsehoods, often referred to as \"AI hallucinations\". Quick sidebar -- I really don't like the word \"hallucinations\" because I fear it anthropomorphizes AI. I'll explain it a bit. Okay, you've probably heard the news reports of large language models claiming they're human, or claiming they have emotions, or just stating things that are factually wrong. What's actually going on here? Well, large language models predict the next best syntactically correct word, not accurate answers based on understanding of what the human is actually asking for. Which means it's going to sound great, but might be 100% wrong in its answer. This wrong answer is a statistical error. Let's take a simple example. Who authored the poems A, B, C? Let's say they were all authored by the poet X, but there's one source claiming it was the author Z. We have conflicting sources in the training data. ",

Let's say they were all authored by the poet X, but there's one source claiming it was the author Z. We have conflicting sources in the training data. Which one actually wins the argument? Even worse, there may not be a disagreement at all, but again, a statistical error. The response could very well be incorrect because again, the large language models do not understand meaning; these inaccuracies can be exceptionally dangerous. It's even more dangerous when you have large language models annotate its sources for totally bogus answers. Why? Because it gives the perception it has proof when it just doesn't have any. Imagine a call center that has replaced its personnel with a large language model, and it offers a factually wrong answer to a customer. Right, here's your factually wrong answer. Now, imagine how much angrier this customer will be when they can't actually offer a correction via a feedback loop. This brings us to our first mitigation strategy: Explainability. Now, you could offer inline explainability and pair a large language model with the system that offered real data and data lineage and provenance via a knowledge graph. Why did the model say what it just said? Where did it pull its data from? Which sources? The large language model could provide variations on the answer that was offered by the knowledge graph. Next risk: Bias. Do not be surprised if the output for your original query only lists white male Western European poets. Want a more representative answer? Your prompt would have to say something like, \"Can you please give me a list of poets that include women and non-Western Europeans?\" Don't expect the large language model to learn from your prompt.

This brings us to the second mitigation strategy: Culture and Audits. Okay, culture is what people do when no one is looking. It starts with approaching this entire subject with humility, as there is so much that has to be learned and even, I would say, unlearned. You need teams that are truly diverse and multidisciplinary in nature working on AI because AI is a great mirror into our own biases. Let's take the results of our audits of AI models and make corrections to our own organizational culture when there are disparate outcomes. Audit pre-model deployment as well as post-model deployment. Okay, next risk is Consent. Is the data that you are curating representative? Was it gathered with consent? Are there copyright issues? Right! Here's a little copyright symbol. These are things we can and should ask for. This should be included in an easy to find, understandable fact sheet. Oftentimes we subjects, we have no idea where the heck the training data came from these large language models. Where we were that gathered from? Did the developers hoover the dark recesses of the Internet? To mitigate consent-related risk, we need combined efforts of auditing and accountability. Right! Accountability includes establishing AI governance processes, making sure you are compliant to existing laws and regulations, and you're offering ways for people to have their feedback incorporated. Now on to the final risk, Security. Large language models could be used for all sorts of malicious tasks, including leaking people's private information, helping criminals phish, spam, scam. Hackers have gotten AI models to change their original programming, endorsing things like racism, suggesting people do illegal things. It's called jailbreaking.

Another attack is an indirect prompt injection. That's when a third party alters a website, adding hidden data to change the AI's behavior. The result? Automation relying on AI potentially sending out malicious instructions without you even being aware. This brings us to our final mitigation strategy, and the one that actually pulls all of this together, and that is education. All right, let me give you an example. Training a brand new large language model produces as much carbon as over a 100 roundtrip flights between New York and Beijing. I know, crazy, right? This means it's important that we know the strengths and weaknesses of this technology. It means educating our own people on principles for the responsible curation of AI, the risks, the environmental cost, the safeguard rails, as well as what the opportunities are. Let me give you another example of where education matters. Today, some tech companies are just trusting that large language models training data has not been maliciously tampered with. I can buy a domain myself now and fill it with bogus data. By poisoning the dataset with enough examples, you could influence a large language model's behavior and outputs forever. This tech isn't going anywhere. We need to think about the relationship that we ultimately want to have with AI. If we're going to use it to augment human intelligence, we have to ask ourselves the question: What is the experience like of a person who has been augmented? Are they indeed empowered? Help us make education about the subject of data and AI far more accessible and inclusive than it is today.

Number one-- the distance from the Earth to the Moon is 54 million kilometers. Number two-- before I worked at IBM, I worked at a major Australian airline. And number three-- the James Webb Telescope took the very first pictures of an exoplanet outside of our solar system. What's the common thread? Well, the answer is that all three \"facts\" are an example of an hallucination of a large language model, otherwise known as an LLM. Things like chatGPT and Bing chat. 54 million K, that's the distance to Mars, not the moon. It's my brother that works at the airline, not me. And infamously, at the announcement of Google's LLM, Bard, it hallucinated about the Webb telescope. The first picture of an exoplanet it was actually taken in 2004. Now, while large language models can generate fluent and coherent text on various topics and domains, they are also prone to just \"make stuff up\". Plausible sounding nonsense! So let's discuss, first of all, what a hallucination is. We'll discuss why they happen. And we'll take some steps to describe how you can minimize hallucinations with LLMs. Now hallucinations are outputs of LLMs that deviate from facts or contextual logic, and they can range from minor inconsistencies to completely fabricated or contradictory statements. And we can categorize hallucinations across different levels of granularity. Now, at the lowest level of granularity we could consider sentence contradiction. This is really the simplest type, and this is where an LLM generates a sentence that contradicts one of the previous sentences. So \"the sky is blue today.\" \"The sky is green today.\" Another example would be prompt contradiction. And this is where the generated sentence contradicts with the prompt that was used to generate it. So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a",

So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a restaurant and its returns, "the food was terrible and the service was rude," ah, that would be in direct contradiction to what I asked. Now, we already gave some examples of another type here, which is a factual contradictions. And these factual contradictions, or factual error hallucinations, are really just that-- absolutely nailed on facts that they got wrong. Barack Obama was the first president of the United States-- something like that. And then there are also nonsensical or otherwise irrelevant kind of information based hallucinations where it just puts in something that really has no place being there. Like "The capital of France is Paris." "Paris is also the name of a famous singer." Okay, umm, thanks? Now with the question of what LLMs hallucinations are answered, we really need to answer the question of why. And it\'s not an easy one to answer, because the way that they derive their output is something of a black box, even to the engineers of the LLM itself. But there are a number of common causes. So let\'s take a look at a few of those. One of those is a data quality. Now LLMs are trained on a large corpora of text that may contain noise, errors, biases or inconsistencies. For example, some LLMs were trained by scraping all of Wikipedia and all of Reddit. It is everything on Reddit 100% accurate? Well, look, even if it was even if the training data was entirely reliable, that data may not cover all of the possible topics or domains the LLMs are expected to generate content about. So LLMs may generalize from data without being able to verify its accuracy or relevance. And sometimes it just',

                "content": " of Reddit. It is everything on Reddit 100% accurate? Well, look, even if it was even if the training data was entirely reliable, that data may not cover all of the possible topics or domains the LLMs are expected to generate content about. So LLMs may generalize from data without being able to verify its accuracy or relevance. And sometimes it just gets it wrong. As LLM reasoning capabilities improve, hallucinations tend to decline. Now, another reason why hallucinations can happen is based upon the generation method. Now, LLMs use various methods and objectives to generate text such as beam search, sampling, maximum likelihood estimation, or reinforcement learning. And these methods and these objectives may introduce biases and tradeoffs between things like fluency and diversity, between coherence and creativity, or between accuracy and novelty. So, for example, beam search may favor high probability, but generic words over low probability, but specific words. And another common cause for hallucinations is input context. And this is one we can do something directly about as users. Now, here, context refers to the information that is given to the model as an input prompt. Context can help guide the model to produce the relevant and accurate outputs, but it can also confuse or mislead the model if it's unclear or if it's inconsistent or if it's contradictory. So, for example, if I ask an LLM chat bot, \"Can cats speak English?\" I would expect the answer \"No, and do you need to sit down for a moment?\". But perhaps I just forgotten to include a crucial little bit of information, a bit of context that this conversation thread is talking about the Garfield cartoon strip, in which case the LLM should have answered, \"Yes, cats can speak English and that cat is probably going to ask for second helpings of lasagna.\" Context is important, and if we don't tell it we're looking for generated text suitable for an academic essay or a creative writing exercise, we can't expect it to respond within that context. Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can",

Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can we do to reduce hallucinations in our own conversations with LLMs? So, yep, one thing we can certainly do is provide clear and specific prompts to the system. Now, the more precise and the more detailed the input prompt, the more likely the LLM will generate relevant and, most importantly, accurate outputs. So, for example, instead of asking \"What happened in World War Two?\" That's not very clear. It's not very specific. We could say, \"Can you summarize the major events of World War Two, including the key countries involved in the primary causes of the conflict?\" Something like that that really gets at what we are trying to pull from this. That gives the model a better understanding of what information is expected in the response. We can employ something called active mitigation strategies. And what these are are using some of the settings of the LLMs, such as settings that control the parameters of how the LLM works during generation. A good example of that is the temperature parameter, which can control the randomness of the output. So a lower temperature will produce more conservative and focused responses, while a higher temperature will generate more diverse and creative ones. But the higher the temperature, the more opportunity for hallucination. And then one more is multi-shot prompting. And in contrast to single shot prompting where we only gave one prompt, multi-shot prompting provides the LLM with multiple examples of the desired output format or context, and that essentially primes the model, giving a clearer understanding of the user's expectations. By presenting the LLM with several examples, we help it recognize the pattern or the context more effectively, and this can be particularly useful in tasks that",

So, generating code, writing poetry or answering questions in a specific style. So while large language models may sometimes hallucinate and take us on an unexpected journey, 54 million kilometers off target, understanding the causes and employing the strategies to minimize those causes really allows us to harness the true potential of these models and reduce hallucinations.

Number one-- the distance from the Earth to the Moon is 54 million kilometers. Number two-- before I worked at IBM, I worked at a major Australian airline. And number three-- the James Webb Telescope took the very first pictures of an exoplanet outside of our solar system. What's the common thread? Well, the answer is that all three \"facts\" are an example of an hallucination of a large language model, otherwise known as an LLM. Things like chatGPT and Bing chat. 54 million K, that's the distance to Mars, not the moon. It's my brother that works at the airline, not me. And infamously, at the announcement of Google's LLM, Bard, it hallucinated about the Webb telescope. The first picture of an exoplanet it was actually taken in 2004. Now, while large language models can generate fluent and coherent text on various topics and domains, they are also prone to just \"make stuff up\". Plausible sounding nonsense! So let's discuss, first of all, what a hallucination is. We'll discuss why they happen. And we'll take some steps to describe how you can minimize hallucinations with LLMs. Now hallucinations are outputs of LLMs that deviate from facts or contextual logic, and they can range from minor inconsistencies to completely fabricated or contradictory statements. And we can categorize hallucinations across different levels of granularity. Now, at the lowest level of granularity we could consider sentence contradiction. This is really the simplest type, and this is where an LLM generates a sentence that contradicts one of the previous sentences. So \"the sky is blue today.\" \"The sky is green today.\" Another example would be prompt contradiction. And this is where the generated sentence contradicts with the prompt that was used to generate it. So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a",

So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a restaurant and its returns, "the food was terrible and the service was rude," ah, that would be in direct contradiction to what I asked. Now, we already gave some examples of another type here, which is a factual contradictions. And these factual contradictions, or factual error hallucinations, are really just that-- absolutely nailed on facts that they got wrong. Barack Obama was the first president of the United States-- something like that. And then there are also nonsensical or otherwise irrelevant kind of information based hallucinations where it just puts in something that really has no place being there. Like "The capital of France is Paris." "Paris is also the name of a famous singer." Okay, umm, thanks? Now with the question of what LLMs hallucinations are answered, we really need to answer the question of why. And it\'s not an easy one to answer, because the way that they derive their output is something of a black box, even to the engineers of the LLM itself. But there are a number of common causes. So let\'s take a look at a few of those. One of those is a data quality. Now LLMs are trained on a large corpora of text that may contain noise, errors, biases or inconsistencies. For example, some LLMs were trained by scraping all of Wikipedia and all of Reddit. It is everything on Reddit 100% accurate? Well, look, even if it was even if the training data was entirely reliable, that data may not cover all of the possible topics or domains the LLMs are expected to generate content about. So LLMs may generalize from data without being able to verify its accuracy or relevance. And sometimes it just',

Now, another reason why hallucinations can happen is based upon the generation method. Now, LLMs use various methods and objectives to generate text such as beam search, sampling, maximum likelihood estimation, or reinforcement learning. And these methods and these objectives may introduce biases and tradeoffs between things like fluency and diversity, between coherence and creativity, or between accuracy and novelty. So, for example, beam search may favor high probability, but generic words over low probability, but specific words. And another common cause for hallucinations is input context. And this is one we can do something directly about as users. Now, here, context refers to the information that is given to the model as an input prompt. Context can help guide the model to produce the relevant and accurate outputs, but it can also confuse or mislead the model if it's unclear or if it's inconsistent or if it's contradictory. So, for example, if I ask an LLM chat bot, \"Can cats speak English?\" I would expect the answer \"No, and do you need to sit down for a moment?\". But perhaps I just forgotten to include a crucial little bit of information, a bit of context that this conversation thread is talking about the Garfield cartoon strip, in which case the LLM should have answered, \"Yes, cats can speak English and that cat is probably going to ask for second helpings of lasagna.\" Context is important, and if we don't tell it we're looking for generated text suitable for an academic essay or a creative writing exercise, we can't expect it to respond within that context. Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can",

Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can we do to reduce hallucinations in our own conversations with LLMs? So, yep, one thing we can certainly do is provide clear and specific prompts to the system. Now, the more precise and the more detailed the input prompt, the more likely the LLM will generate relevant and, most importantly, accurate outputs. So, for example, instead of asking \"What happened in World War Two?\" That's not very clear. It's not very specific. We could say, \"Can you summarize the major events of World War Two, including the key countries involved in the primary causes of the conflict?\" Something like that that really gets at what we are trying to pull from this. That gives the model a better understanding of what information is expected in the response. We can employ something called active mitigation strategies. And what these are are using some of the settings of the LLMs, such as settings that control the parameters of how the LLM works during generation. A good example of that is the temperature parameter, which can control the randomness of the output. So a lower temperature will produce more conservative and focused responses, while a higher temperature will generate more diverse and creative ones. But the higher the temperature, the more opportunity for hallucination. And then one more is multi-shot prompting. And in contrast to single shot prompting where we only gave one prompt, multi-shot prompting provides the LLM with multiple examples of the desired output format or context, and that essentially primes the model, giving a clearer understanding of the user's expectations. By presenting the LLM with several examples, we help it recognize the pattern or the context more effectively, and this can be particularly useful in tasks that",

So, generating code, writing poetry or answering questions in a specific style. So while large language models may sometimes hallucinate and take us on an unexpected journey, 54 million kilometers off target, understanding the causes and employing the strategies to minimize those causes really allows us to harness the true potential of these models and reduce hallucinations.

Chachi BT ran on a new version of an older language model it worked just the way other large language models worked but it was much larger and that seemed to create a new kind of AI something was far more cable than we ever had expected before and one of the ways you can see this is by looking at test scores so previous large language models couldn't do tests at all and then chat CBT started to score really well we were getting something like you know at the 25th percentile of the GRE The Graduate exam in quantitative testing 66 percentile beating 66 percent of humans in the GRE qualitative doing really well on the AP exams doing very well on sats completely unexpectedly and GPD 3.5 the chat gbt model was just the start gpd4 which was released just a few months later with scoring in the 99th percentile in the GRE exams in verbal and scoring at the 85th percentile in the law exam and this was a completely ID: ",

So I think we can all agree that studying takes far, far too much time so what I wanna do in this video is show you guys how you can remember more of what you learn, even if you\'re spending fewer actual hours studying, and the way to do that is by spacing out that study time. This is a technique called spaced repetition and to do it you add progressively longer and longer time intervals in between each of your study sessions. So in this video I wanna show you exactly how you can do that, both with your paper flash cards and with apps both for smartphones and computers. But first I wanted to get into why this technique is so powerful and also talk to you a little bit about the history behind it and how it relates to our memories in general. Spaced repetition leverages a memory phenomenon known as the spacing effect, which describes how our brains make better connections and overall remember things more effectively when we space out our learning over time. How\'s how Pierce J. Howard, the author of my least favorite book to haul into coffee shops, puts it: "Work involving higher mental functions, "such as analysis and synthesis, needs to be "spaced out in order to allow new neural "connections to solidify. "New learning drives out old learning when "insufficient time intervenes." And we\'ve actually known about this effect for quite a long time. Back in the late-1800s a psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus basically launched the field of memory science itself by embarking upon an intense study where he made himself memorize long, long lists of nonsense syllables.

Back in the late-1800s a psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus basically launched the field of memory science itself by embarking upon an intense study where he made himself memorize long, long lists of nonsense syllables. And through that research he eventually came to develop what's called The Forgetting Curve, which describes how memories decay over time. But what he also learned was that by spacing out his efforts to memorize these lists, he could put in less actual study time to get them memorized perfectly. For example, for one list of 12 syllables he found out it took him 68 repetitions on one day and then seven repetitions the next day to memorize it perfectly, but by spacing out his studying over the course of three days he found he could achieve his same level of perfection in only 38 repetitions. Over the past 130 years since he published his findings, lots of other studies have been able to replicate this same positive results, which leads us to the question, \"Why does the spacing effect work?\" Well to put it in simple terms, it turns out that one of the most important parts of learning process is actually forgetting. Now what forgetting truly is is a subject for another video that I'll publish in the future, but the most important thing to note here is that the more we've forgotten something, that is the harder we have to work to retrieve it since we last learned it or studied it, the greater the increase in learning will be. To make this a bit more clear, here's how the author Benedict Carey, who wrote the book \"How We",

And I would add to that the fact that you can do this with basically any other learning technique. It's entirely complementary because it's all about just modifying the time periods in which you study. You can do anything within those time periods, you're just using the time periods as intelligently as possible. With that being said, now I wanna get into how you can put spaced repetition into action and implement it into your own study systems. And we're gonna talk about apps and computer programs that you can use in a minute here but first I want to talk about a system that you can use with your paper flash cards, which is called the Leitner System, and here's how it works. The first step is to decide on the number of boxes that you're gonna use to hold the cards in your system. Now I don't actually own little boxes so I've just substituted rubber bands and sticky notes that say \"Box,\" but that actually works just",

Now I don't actually own little boxes so I've just substituted rubber bands and sticky notes that say \"Box,\" but that actually works just as well and actually makes the system more portable, so that's pretty cool, and from there each individual box is going to represent a different study time interval. So Box 1 might be studying every day, Box 2 might be studied every other day, and so on. And when you're studying the cards in the boxes, every time you get a card right it's gonna graduate to the next box, so you're gonna see it less and less often. But if you get a card wrong, it's gonna go all the way to box number 1, no matter where it was. And by using this system you get two main benefits. Number one, you're maximizing your learning through the spacing effect, but number two, you're also studying more efficiently because you're spending more time on the cards that need the most attention and less time on the ones you know really well rather than studying every single card equally. Now this paper system works really well for both of those goals but if you wanna take advantage of more advanced scheduling algorithms and other features, you're gonna need to find yourself a space repetition app and there are a lot of contenders in this area but I wanna focus first on what is probably the most popular one right now and that is called Anki.

Anki has a huge community, it's insanely customizable, and best of all, it has apps for almost every platform out there and almost all of them are free with the exception of the iPhone app, which oddly costs a whopping $25. Now I think the price is that high because it's their way of basically letting people support the app since it's free everywhere else but if you're on an iPhone and you don't wanna pay that much, fear not because Anki also has a companion web app called AnkiWeb, which is accessible from mobile Safari. So you can use that free if you want. Now with Anki, creating cards is really, really easy and I really like the fact that you can add basically any kind of media you want to your cards, including pictures, which is awesome because adding pictures to your flash cards can really help increase retention. However, the killer feature of Anki is the ability to rate cards based on difficulty when you're studying them. So essentially, when you turn a card over, you can tell the program how hard it was for you to dredge the answer up from the depths of your memory and it will use that data to decide how long it's gonna be before you see that card again. And that's really the main strength of space repetition apps versus a paper system. Each individual card can be tracked, can have a difficulty rating, and can be adjusted in the algorithm so you're getting the most benefit of the spacing effect. ",

Anki is definitely not the only space repetition app out there, though, so if you're looking for alternatives, I've got a few things in mind for you to take a look at, number one being an app called TinyCards, which I showed off in my previous video on how to make better flash cards. Now TinyCards is only for the iPhone, unfortunately, but there should be an Android version coming soon, and honestly, when compared to Anki I think it's a lot more simple, a lot prettier, and the process of making cards is more fun and faster because they have an excellent system for adding images to your cards. Aside from TinyCards there are also apps like Flashcards Deluxe, Memrise, SuperMemo, Mnemosyne, Eidetic, Quizlet, and probably a bunch of others that I don't even know about right now but I'm sure you will let me know about down in the Comments.

Now one cool thing about these shirts' design is it was actually created by the College Info Geek community. My good friend Ashley did the hand-lettered design itself but the mantra or saying on the shirt was actually decided upon by people in the College Info Geek community over on Reddit, which I think is really, really cool, and I would love to continue to play up this community aspect so if you get a shirt I would love to see you tweeting awesome pictures of you wearing it to send to me over on @TomFrankly and I will probably retweet them. You can also put them in the Reddit as well if you like and other than that, that's all I have for this video, guys, so thanks so much for watching.

First, you get 30 seconds to memorize 10 words in the right order. After that, you get 30 seconds to write down what you remembered. And then finally, you get 30 seconds to check your answers. So, are you guys ready? Well, we're going to start anyway. So, memorize 10 words in the right order in 30 seconds in three, two, one, go! OK. Stop. Now write down what you remember. OK, and stop. Now quickly check your answers. OK, and stop. Very exciting; I heard a lot of grunting and moaning. So I hope I didn't stress you out too much. Now a moment of reflection. I'd like you to ask yourself, \"How did I memorize this, and was it the best way to do it?\" Now, for the generation of my parents and grandparents, being able to memorize something like this was an absolutely essential skill. But nowadays, why would anyone want to remember a list of anything? You just take a picture of the screen, and you're done, right? it seemed as if memorizing has somehow become less important. So why should we then, in today's day and age, still want to get better at memorizing? Well, to answer that question, I'd like to tell you a little story. In high school, I flunked a grade, twice. After seven years of torture, I finally got my diploma. Sweet, sweet freedom! What would I do with it? I didn't know. ",

One thing I did know, however, was that I didn't want to go back to school because that old learning business, it wasn't cut out for me. So instead, I went to sunny California for nine months, and there I worked as a bagger, not beggar - bagger. So in a supermarket, I had to put people's groceries in bags, and then I'd get a little tip. Surprisingly, that year I learned so much. I learned how to bag a bunch of groceries really, really quickly. I learned how to drive a car. And in California, people are a little bit more open than they are in Amsterdam. So I also learned how to have a little chat with a stranger, just for the hell of it. That year I discovered that I don't hate learning, just the specific way of doing it. So I decided to go and study psychology. Now for the first time ever, I was getting information that I absolutely wanted to know. Now I was spending more time in the library than I spent skipping school as a teenager, voluntarily. The only problem was that I was spending all of my time in the library because I'd never learned how to learn. So I started experimenting with different methods of reading texts, of memorizing texts, and I got my reading time of three hours per chapter down to one. This way of studying enabled me to do an honors program, to get my degree, and to fall in love with learning. ID",

And now I happily work for a company called Remind, in which we teach people the science and art of learning. We're trying to bring back into education what we ourselves missed. Now for the past three years, we've also organized the Dutch National Memory Championships for high schoolers. We do this to show that everybody is capable of amazing feats of memory, but also to show that memorization is about a lot more than just learning your French or your Spanish words. And today I'd also like to share this with you. So, in the beginning, I made you do this little test, just to make you aware of how you're memorizing things right now. Next, I'd like to give you a new type of memory experience. This time you can even sit back and relax. So I'm going to ask you to find a comfortable position to sit, to close your eyes, and to take a deep breath. Now, I want you to think of someone you know called John, and I want you to see him.

But I asked you guys in the beginning, \"Why should we, in today's day and age, still want to get better at this - at memorizing?\" Well, because by getting better in a skill like this, you can also get better at a different skill: the skill of experimentation. By experimenting with different methods of doing things, I found out that I can get better at anything. I found out what works for me and what doesn't. What if I'd never learned the skill of experimentation? I may have never gone back to school; I may have never enjoyed studying psychology, and I probably would not have been standing here today, because one of the things I thought I really couldn't do was public speaking. Now, there are people of every generation not doing things that they might love, that they might even be great at because they think they can't do it. So how beautiful would it be if in schools we can teach kids that they can get better at anything, and they can even get better at getting better at things, get it? But not just the kids, because the older generation is often seen as too old to learn. But they're not too rusty. Anyone can improve themselves by experimenting, and I hope you experienced that today. Now at Remind, we break up this process of experimentation into three steps: the check, the experience and the experiment. The check is all about becoming aware of what you're doing right now. So maybe during the first test, you became aware of the fact that you just repeat the words over and over and that that doesn't work too well. The second step: the experience is all about being open to new possibilities and trying them out. So maybe during the visualization",

This is about taking something from that new experience that you had and applying it in your own life to see how it works for you. So, maybe you're one of those people that when someone introduces themselves to you, you just immediately forget their name. Yeah, sound familiar? And you want to use visualization to do something about that. So far I've only taken you guys through the first two steps. The final step is up to you. So when I'm done here, I'd like you to take a moment for yourself and to write down an experiment on the little card we've given you and to put that in your wallet as a reminder. By continually following these steps of experimentation, you discover what you're doing; you keep yourself open to new possibilities, and you allow yourself to continually transform. And regardless of what you're learning, be it memorizing or martial arts or mathematics, you'll get better not only in the skill that you're trying to develop, but you'll get better at the process of learning itself. And that's something that sticks. It's something you could take with you to your new job, your new hobby, your new relationship, your new whatever.

In order to use some of that staggering capacity a little more effectively when you learn, here are some tips that are based on widely accepted research by neuroscientists and learning experts. “Spaced Repetition" To maximise your learning, study short but often. Neuroscientist proved that synapses, the million billion connections in your brain that make you remember and understand stuff, grow mainly at night when you are asleep. This means that it is more productive to study regularly with sleeping breaks in between. Try it! Practice something for 15 minutes every day and you’ll be surprised by your progress within just weeks. “Find Your Own Style” While listening to the history teacher, Tom scribbles images and Jane finishes 1 kilo of nuts. Some enjoy watching videos over reading books, others study with friends and some like sitting in silence among a million books. Everybody is different. “Good Night’s Sleep” Sleep and dreams are vital to processing and storing new information. A Harvard study showed that students who had a good night’s sleep remembered their study materials 35% better than those who studied in the morning to take a test in the evening. “Focus!” If you tend to procrastinate, which means that you tend to switch from doing something hard like studying maths to something easy like browsing the web, protect yourself from distraction. One way of doing this is to shut down your mobile phone or go to a quite place like a library. “Pomodoro Technique” Set a timer to 25 minutes when you focus entirely on your studies.

When the timer rings, relax for 5 minutes. If you want to continue just set the timer again. The small breaks in between are relaxing and motivating to keep going. “Hard Stuff First” Do the things that are difficult first. Because if you are like most people, you have the strongest willpower in the morning. Once you are done with the hard stuff you will feel better for the rest of the day and probably more motivated to get other things done. “Exercise, Meditate and Converse” There are few activities proven to grow your brain however physical exercise, regular meditation and good conversations apparently do exactly that. They lead to the creation of new neurons inside your brain and therefore grow its potential. “Go Places!” You can create deeper memories of a subject by learning in a richer environment that offers more visual clues. In an experiment two groups of students had to remember random words. One group changed the classroom while studying, the other didn’t. The group that studied in two different rooms (one was small and windowless, the other big and bright) was 40% more likely to recall the words later. “Take Fun Seriously” Whatever it is, find a fun way to practice. Modern learning science believes that positive emotions are very important for increasing your learning potential. So do yourself a favour and have a good time! “Space Your Studies” In order to remember things for a longer time, repeat the material in spaced intervals. Facts or",

                "content": " Seriously” Whatever it is, find a fun way to practice. Modern learning science believes that positive emotions are very important for increasing your learning potential. So do yourself a favour and have a good time! “Space Your Studies” In order to remember things for a longer time, repeat the material in spaced intervals. Facts or vocabularies for example are best learned if you review them the first time 1-2 days after the initial study and then again after 1 week and after 1 month. “30% Read 70% Recite” If you have one hour to learn to recite a poem or prepare for a speech spend 20 Minutes of the time on studying the text and 40 minutes on practicing to recite. This ratio usually leads to the best results. In the case of an emergency, put a glass of water next to you. Take a sip whenever you lose it ;) “Instant Self-Test” After you study finish up with a quick quiz. Immediate recall in form of a test or a short summary on what you’ve just learned can increase retention by as much as 30%. Because it’s much harder for your brain to reflect than to read, that extra effort creates deeper traces in your memory. “Don’t Force it” Motivation is like hunger. You cannot force yourself to be motivated just like you can’t tell someone else to be hungry. So if you are not hungry right now, don’t worry. Take a break and do something else.",

Whether you click this video because you have a test tomorrow or in an hour or you just wanted to understand the most efficient way to learn a new skill or language, you've come to the right place. there's a lot of learning hack videos on the internet but the truth is very few of them are using techniques that have been rigorously studied and most are not backed by science so, today to save your time we have gone through the research and are here to tell you that there are only three techniques that have been proven to work. They'll not only save your time but  they'll make the information stick with you much more efficiently. Two of the tips will help you right now because i know a lot of you are here searching up how to study quickly cause you have a test really soon whereas the other ones more useful if you have a little more leeway and are trying to learn a a skill that you want to stick with you for a long time. we would leave there all, a little surprising and counter intuitive. So, it was really fascinating to know that the research found these to be the most effective techniques We were also inspired by the bill and melinda gates annual letter who is the sponsor of today's video. Their letter actually touches on the concept of evidence based learning initiatives to improve education. We'll talk more about their letter at the end of the episode. in the meantime we are gonna get those three learning techniques that will help you right now. The first technique has to do with something called 'the generation effect'. and it involves tests. Okay you are triggered. being tested is supposed to help others evaluate your progress but it turns out that testing isn't that very good evaluation tool. It actually functions better as a learning tool but ",

Okay you are triggered. being tested is supposed to help others evaluate your progress but it turns out that testing isn't that very good evaluation tool. It actually functions better as a learning tool but only if you do it properly. This may seem Counter intuitive but first you should test yourself before you even know the material. For example start with the practice test even before you started studying it. You'll get answers wrong But your brain is forced to generate an answer, you'll be creative Panicked and end up priming your neurology To remember that information later This is linked to something called the hyper-correction effect Which is why i sometimes getting the wrong answer at first may be even more effective. The hyper- correction effect finds that when you make a mistake on some type of general information and later find out you're wrong you're much more likely to remember the correct answer for example if you're certain that Toronto is the capital city of Canada but later find Out that it is infact Ottawa. you are much more likely to remember that forever compared to somebody who wasn't really sure in the first place and was simply told the answer is Ottawa. your brain hyper-corrects. One theory behind this states that surprise and embarrassment play a role it can actually be very tough to be embarrassed and even From evolutionary perspective it can lead to a lack of social cohesion and sort of negatively impact yourself in a group. Essentially your brain doesn't wanna be embarrassed Therefore your brain works extra hard to make sure it doesn't make the same mistake twice. This leads you to retain the information",

Essentially your brain doesn't wanna be embarrassed Therefore your brain works extra hard to make sure it doesn't make the same mistake twice. This leads you to retain the information better and learn more effectively. in shorts do tests too early, fail, so that when you learn the correct answer you actually retain the information better. Actually think anecdotally i have experienced this hyper-correction effect in my first year university the physics course specifically, so we had to these quizzes that you were required to get 8 out of 10 to pass all in the mark and you had three tries to get 8 out of 10. Now i had some smart friends who on their first try would nail it but for me it actually usually took me three times so ultimately i was constantly hyper-correcting because i realized i did it wrong and was explained how to do it properly. By the end of semester i ended up doing better on the final exams than my friends and i think this is because of the hyper-correction effect i had to constantly challenge my inaccurate beliefs earlier on which ultimately improved my long term memory and learning ability. so again test yourself early and often and force your brain to generate an answer even is it's the wrong answer and then follow up by learning the correct answers technique number 2 is called 'SPACING', Now a lot of us tend to study right before an exam may be if you're really smart you'll give yourself like a full week But this is actually gonna take even more time than that for spacing you are gonna wanna practice and then wait long enough to almost forget ID:",

After only getting 8 hours of practice they tested them 8 years later Both groups were tested on their Spanish vocabulary and by now we probably guessed the group that spaced their studying over a month gap performed 250% better. Remember this is 8 years later that they're being tested So ultimately we're talking about a huge increase in long term retention when these space help your study. i found this really helps from my stand up comedy practicing so essentially what you have to do is memorize routines sort of similar to like in high school you have to memorize lines for a play i usually will practice the day before and the day of digging at the closer i am to my show the better i will be retaining the information.

The last rigorously supported learning technique is called 'INTERLEAVING', So what studies have found is that instead of studying the same thing over and over and over if you mix up or vary the challenge the benefits are huge In the moment this process might be a lot More frustrating and you may even think that you are learning more slowly but that's why it's so counter intuitive. Lets take a look at some examples that could apply to your life. All of which have come from one of my Favorite books in the last year called Range By david epstein. If you have any interest in High performance and improving skills This book literally changed my perspective on improving at things so i highly recommend it. First we are gonna talk about motor skills like piano so a particularly tricky thing to do is to jump a big inter violin piano really quickly so say starting at c and then jumping up 20 keys really quickly It takes a lot of coordination and muscle memories to do that quickly without thinking about it without accidentally hitting other keys along the way. so this study had one group practiced the 20 key jump over and over and over and they have gone relatively good at it pretty quickly But the second group had to practice not only the 20 key jump but also mixing a 15 key jump and a 10 key jump So ultimately they had less practiced but the 20 key jump but had interleaved or mixed practiced",

Even though they technically had less practice with it the same has been shown in math. Rather than practicing one type of problem over and over mixing in different kinds of problems in between makes the process harder but develops stronger skills. ultimately what's happening is that you are developing strategies to problems in a broad sense. Instead of simply using a specific procedure your brain has to make abstract generalizations which helps to make your knowledge more flexible. it's very shocking how bigger difference this type of interleaving makes. in extremely significant randomized controlled study looked at maths skills in grade 7 students. Those that used interleaving or mixed practice saw an effect size of approving someone's from the 50% of skill to the 80%. that is like going from being an average student to being someone who is closer to the top of the class if you're using cue cards make sure that you're mixing up different themes within those cue cards after studying the same things essentially you gotta mix things up all this research is incredibly  significant because it",

In order to improve our existing systems we need to use rigorously studied research. Be innovative and ultimately take big risks. That's the best way to find solutions to problems that won't just go away on their own. one of the coolest things that we learn from their letter and from research is that there is no one size fits all solution to education. it's all dependent on the demographics, the culture and the communities that each specific school is trying to serve. the bill and melinda gates have supported innovations led by leaders who know that space. one example is that they have find out the importance of mitigating the amount of courses that a student fails. That may seem obvious but if a student fails no more than one course they're are four times more likely to graduate than someone who fails two or more courses. At every school and community has a specific challenge that their student body is going to face and that's why their solutions are gonna need to be unique. This year we are committed",

The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student",

Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, \"Tell me the answer,\" it says, \"I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?\" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, ",

What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?\" Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, \"To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame.\" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my",

It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, \"Well, what do you care about?\" And let's say the student says, \"I want to be a professional athlete.\" And it says, \"Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc.\" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch.

And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name\'s Saanvi. And she was doing a report on "The Great Gatsby." And when she was reading "The Great Gatsby," Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she\'s like, "Why does he do that?" She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, "Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, "Why do you keep staring at the green light?" "Ah, the green light, old sport. It\'s a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It\'s situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan\'s dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life." And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” ID: ',

But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying \"This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate.\" And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, \"It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write.\" But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing",

So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, \"Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries.\" And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, \"Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident.\" And the AI says, \"Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,\" etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago.

And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, \"Does my evidence support my claim?\" And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, \"On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,\" but once again, Socratically says, \"Can you tell us why?\" So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before.

And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities.

And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, \"The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they",

Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step.\" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that",

And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose.

Karl's findings now you might be wondering how could you apply active recall to your learning habits when I first came across this concept I did a number of experiments and try to apply it to my studies I tried reading material for my textbook and then explaining the concept to myself or someone else this worked for a while because I had a good grasp on what the concepts were but the problem was however that the majority of the subjects that I took had a tendency to lean towards facts rather than concepts I struggled with this for a while but eventually I came across on key I loved Anki I can't express how useful it was for me when I was stud for my exams back in undergrad on fees a free SRS spaced repetition flashcard app that uses both active recall and spaced repetition and I can make an entire video of me talking about how I use Anki but I'm just gonna give an example right here whenever I read material for my textbook let's say glycated hemoglobin reflects the average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months so after that I would convert the statement into the form of a question so what would come out as like a Tiki mug loeben reflects the blood glucose level over what times found next I type out the answer which is two to three months so after I place the question into the deck ",

OpenAI GPT-2 is a learning-based technique which can perform common natural language processing operations, for instance, answering questions, completing text, reading comprehension, summarization, and more. What is absolutely amazing about this technique is that it is able to perform these tasks with as little supervision as possible. This means that we unleash the algorithm that they call GPT-2 to read the internet, and it will learn our language by itself. To perform this, of course, we need a lot of training data, and here, the AI reads 40 gigabytes of internet text, which is 40 gigs of non-binary plaintext data, which is a stupendously large amount of text. You see here an example of how it fares with text completion, and the results were absolutely amazing. And, not only that, because, hold on to your papers, we can now try it ourselves and my results show that it can be wise as a scholar, and it can also cheat like nobody’s business. So, let’s try something simple here. Well, first, as everyone is talking about job security, I’d like to give it the start of this Two Minute Papers script and see if I am about to be replaced. Let’s see! It continues the intro with “The history of Eastern Europe since 1989 has been an interesting and complex story spanning four decades. On one side you have a regime of Western-backed dictators from the mid-1990s” and so on. Very scholarly indeed. However, I think I might be safe …for now. And now, something that I wanted to try since the inception of GPT-2, which is, feed it a snippet of something that I said about Wavelet Turbulence, which is one of the best papers ever written, and have the AI finish it. I tried",

And now, something that I wanted to try since the inception of GPT-2, which is, feed it a snippet of something that I said about Wavelet Turbulence, which is one of the best papers ever written, and have the AI finish it. I tried to frame it as an exam question and was not disappointed be the results. So the text is, “There was a similar technique by the name Wavelet Turbulence, which is”, I hope you see what I did there…and look what it did! “There was a similar technique by the name Wavelet Turbulence, which is not at all what we are talking about, but I'll let you decide whether it is worth your time to read it.” Wow! GPT-2 has been caught cheating red handed. I love it. Let’s continue what it had to say: “Anyway, my aim here is to describe how we use a fluid simulation to simulate smoke and liquid effects using just a few simple equations: Solving a few functions gives us a set of derivatives of the particle trajectories, that is equations that describe how and where the particles will come and go across the liquid in the simulation. For simplicity (as a good teacher of high-school students should know) we can use a simple equation, which simulates two particles that collide.” I am stunned. It recognized that we are talking about fluid simulations, which is already remarkable, but it went much further - The completion is not bad at all and is not only coherent, on topic, but has quite a bit of truth to it. I will have to rethink my previous claim about my job security. The even crazier thing is that the size of this model is about 750 million parameters, which is only half of the size of the original full model, which is expected to be even better.

The even crazier thing is that the size of this model is about 750 million parameters, which is only half of the size of the original full model, which is expected to be even better. I put a link to this website in the video description for your pleasure, make sure to play with it, this is mad fun. And, GPT-2 will also see so many applications that we cannot even fathom yet. For instance, here you can see that one can train it on many source code files on GitHub and it will be able to complete the code that we write on the fly. Now, nobody should think of this as GPT-2 writing programs for us, this is, of course, unlikely, however, it will ease the process for novice and experts users alike. If you have any other novel applications in mind, make sure to leave a comment below. For now, bravo OpenAI, and a big thank you for Daniel King and the Hugging Face company for this super convenient public implementation. Let the  experiments begin! Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!",

Normally, this is OpenAI’s chat assistant, where we get a little text  box, enter our questions as a text prompt, and it shall answer. However, get this, today,  we don’t even need to prompt ChatGPT anymore, because, and now, hold on to your papers,  because it can prompt itself. What? How? That sounds insane. But yes, all that  is true. We can describe a complex task, and it will by itself break it down into smaller  steps. And it also does them all! For instance, here it is asked to buy a pair of AirPods,  and as you see, it knows that it first has to search for it, look for deals, yes, we  got one. It is indeed on the right track, and then, gets distracted by a privacy policy.  Or perhaps it knows something we don’t know yet. Yes, this is a version of ChatGPT that  can make decisions and take action. So, what can we use this for? Well, we can even ask it to build  a website for us. And it adds the required goodies, step by step. Really cool! Now, this is Two Minute Papers, so we  want to give it a scholarly task. Oh yes, let’s ask it to research itself. That is one  more task with several steps involved. And, yes, this interface gives us a little opportunity  to pop the hood and hear its thoughts. It first wants to search for AutoGPT, browse around a  little, and finally create an outline about itself for us. Once again, the key part is  that it can take a complex task, and break it into small steps. That is incredible. It also  reminds itself to not wander around too much if it finds a tasty privacy policy, and focus on  the main task instead. Good thinking, little AI! ID",

Now let’s see what happens  then…the search takes place, we get a ton of results, and finally,  it enters GitHub, the home of AutoGPT, we see how it reads through the page,  and finally, we get our answer. Now, my first question was, is this a copy-paste  from the website, or did it really read the whole thing and distill down the information into  one paragraph? Yes it did, good job, little AI! So, at this point, my question was, what is  AutoGPT? What role could this play in our lives? And, have a look at this. We can also get  a progress report where it tells us what it has done, and what there is left to be done. So, yes,  AutoGPT feels very much like a team of assistants. The first version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT is barely a  few months old, and it can already prompt itself, chain prompts together, and report back to us  on where exactly it is. That is incredible. And we can even ask it to have a look at  a piece of computer code. Then, it again, breaks down the task into small pieces.  Evaluation, improvement, and finally, testing. And it does all of that.  Like a team of assistants would. Also, this is a computer that kind of fixes itself.  How cool is that? What a time to be alive! Now, a few more things that you should  know about this. One, by default, it asks for permission before each step. That is a good  idea. Two, these are just the first few steps, and when you start using it, you will find  that it",

Two, these are just the first few steps, and when you start using it, you will find  that it is a bit slow, a bit expensive, and quite limited. Also, I would like to  make sure not to overstate what AutoGPT can do at the moment, however, can you even  imagine what this will be able to do just two more papers down the line? If you have some  ideas, let me know in the comments below. So, do you wish to try it? Can you?  Yes you can! You can run it locally or even try it on the web. I’ve  included both links in the video description. Note that you will  need an API key to perform that. Now, look. What is this? Who are these people?  Are you thinking what I am thinking? Yes, that’s right! This is a long line of you  Fellow Scholars entering an incredible event in London with our long-time partner,  Weights &amp; Biases. And I also flew there to hold the first Two Minute Papers meetup of  sorts ever. Here you see the footage I took, where you Fellow Scholars,  expressed what you really want. Yes, I approve. And here are some Fellow Scholars  who were very happy to get what they wanted. The event was incredible, the energy was electric,  I handed out a hundreds of papers and gifts, and got back what feels like a 100 hugs.  Some crushed my ribs but that’s okay. And what you see here is just a portion of  the thousand plus people who came. It was so amazing to see your faces, say hello and hear your  stories.

This paper does not have the usual visual fireworks that you see in many of these videos, however, it addresses the cornerstone of scientific publication, which is none other than peer review. When a research group is done with a project, they don’t just write up the results and chuck the paper into a repository, but instead, they submit it to a scientific venue, for instance, a journal or a conference. Then, the venue finds several other researchers who are willing to go through the work with a fine-tooth comb. In the case of double-blind reviews, both the authors and the reviewers remain anonymous to each other. The reviewers now check whether the results are indeed significant, novel, credible and reproducible. If the venue is really good, this process is very tough and thorough, and this is process becomes the scientific version of beating the heck out of someone, but in a constructive manner. If the work is able to withstand serious criticism, and ticks the required boxes, it can proceed to get published at this venue. Otherwise, it is rejected. So what we heard so far is that the research work is being reviewed, however, scientists at the Google AI lab raised the issue that the reviewers themselves should also be reviewed. Consider the fact that all scientists are expected to spend a certain percentage of their time to serve the greater good. For instance, throughout my PhD studies, I have reviewed over 30 papers and I am not even done yet. These paper reviews take place without compensation. Let’s call this issue number one for now. Issue number two is the explosive growth of the number of submissions over time at the most prestigious machine learning and computer vision conferences. Have a look here. It is of",

Issue number two is the explosive growth of the number of submissions over time at the most prestigious machine learning and computer vision conferences. Have a look here. It is of utmost importance that we create a review system that is as fair as possible - after all, thousands of hours spent on research projects are at stake. Add these two issues together, and we get a system where the average quality of the reviews will almost certainly decrease over time. Quoting the authors: “We believe the key issues here are structural. Reviewers donate their valuable time and expertise anonymously as a service to the community with no compensation or attribution, are increasingly taxed by a rapidly increasing number of submissions, and are held to no enforced standards.” In Two Minute Papers episode number 84, so more than 200 episodes ago, we discussed the NeurIPS experiment. Leave a comment if you’ve been around back then and you enjoyed Two Minute Papers before it was cool! But don’t worry if this is not the case, this was long ago, so here is a short summary: a large amount of papers were secretly disseminated to multiple committees, who would review it without knowing about each other, and we would have a look whether they would accept or reject the same papers. Re-review papers and see if the results are the same, if you will. If we use sophisticated mathematics to create new scientific methods, why not use mathematics to evaluate our own processes? So, after doing that, it was found that at a given prescribed acceptance ratio, there was a disagreement for 57% of the papers. So, is this number good or bad? Let’s imagine a completely hypothetical committee that has no idea what they are doing, and as a review, they basically toss up a coin and accept or",

So, is this number good or bad? Let’s imagine a completely hypothetical committee that has no idea what they are doing, and as a review, they basically toss up a coin and accept or reject the paper based on the result of the cointoss. Let’s call them the Coinflip Committee. The calculations conclude that the Coinflip Committee would have a disagreement ratio of about 77%. So, experts, 57% disagreement, Coinflip Committee, 77% disagreement. And now, to answer whether this is good or bad: this is hardly something to be proud of — the consistency of expert reviewers is significantly closer to a coinflip than to a hypothetical perfect review process. If that is not an indication that we have to do something about this, I am not sure what is. So, in this paper, the authors propose two important changes to the system to remedy these issues: Remedy number one - they propose a rubric, a 7-point document to evaluate the quality of the reviews. Again, not only the papers are reviewed, but the reviews themselves. It is similar to the ones used in public schools to evaluate student performance to make sure whether the review was objective, consistent and fair. Remedy number two - reviewers should be incentivized and rewarded for their work. The authors argue that a professional service should be worthy of professional compensation. Now, of course, this sounds great, but this also requires money. Where should the funds come from?

And number three-- the James Webb Telescope took the very first pictures of an exoplanet outside of our solar system. What's the common thread? Well, the answer is that all three \"facts\" are an example of an hallucination of a large language model, otherwise known as an LLM. Things like chatGPT and Bing chat. 54 million K, that's the distance to Mars, not the moon. It's my brother that works at the airline, not me. And infamously, at the announcement of Google's LLM, Bard, it hallucinated about the Webb telescope. The first picture of an exoplanet it was actually taken in 2004. Now, while large language models can generate fluent and coherent text on various topics and domains, they are also prone to just \"make stuff up\". Plausible sounding nonsense! So let's discuss, first of all, what a hallucination is. We'll discuss why they happen. And we'll take some steps to describe how you can minimize hallucinations with LLMs. Now hallucinations are outputs of LLMs that deviate from facts or contextual logic, and they can range from minor inconsistencies to completely fabricated or contradictory statements. And we can categorize hallucinations across different levels of granularity. Now, at the lowest level of granularity we could consider sentence contradiction. This is really the simplest type, and this is where an LLM generates a sentence that contradicts one of the previous sentences. So \"the sky is blue today.\" \"The sky is green today.\" Another example would be prompt contradiction. And this is where the generated sentence contradicts with the prompt that was used to generate it. So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a",

"The sky is green today." Another example would be prompt contradiction. And this is where the generated sentence contradicts with the prompt that was used to generate it. So if I ask an LLM to write a positive review of a restaurant and its returns, "the food was terrible and the service was rude," ah, that would be in direct contradiction to what I asked. Now, we already gave some examples of another type here, which is a factual contradictions. And these factual contradictions, or factual error hallucinations, are really just that-- absolutely nailed on facts that they got wrong. Barack Obama was the first president of the United States-- something like that. And then there are also nonsensical or otherwise irrelevant kind of information based hallucinations where it just puts in something that really has no place being there. Like "The capital of France is Paris." "Paris is also the name of a famous singer." Okay, umm, thanks? Now with the question of what LLMs hallucinations are answered, we really need to answer the question of why. And it\'s not an easy one to answer, because the way that they derive their output is something of a black box, even to the engineers of the LLM itself. But there are a number of common causes. So let\'s take a look at a few of those. One of those is a data quality. Now LLMs are trained on a large corpora of text that may contain noise, errors, biases or inconsistencies. For example, some LLMs were trained by scraping all of Wikipedia and all of Reddit. It is everything on Reddit 100% accurate? Well, look, even if it was even if the training data was entirely reliable, that data may not cover all of the possible topics or domains the LLMs are expected to generate content about. So LLMs may generalize from data without being able to verify its accuracy or relevance. And sometimes it just',

                    "maxCueIdx": 44,

                "content": " of Reddit. It is everything on Reddit 100% accurate? Well, look, even if it was even if the training data was entirely reliable, that data may not cover all of the possible topics or domains the LLMs are expected to generate content about. So LLMs may generalize from data without being able to verify its accuracy or relevance. And sometimes it just gets it wrong. As LLM reasoning capabilities improve, hallucinations tend to decline. Now, another reason why hallucinations can happen is based upon the generation method. Now, LLMs use various methods and objectives to generate text such as beam search, sampling, maximum likelihood estimation, or reinforcement learning. And these methods and these objectives may introduce biases and tradeoffs between things like fluency and diversity, between coherence and creativity, or between accuracy and novelty. So, for example, beam search may favor high probability, but generic words over low probability, but specific words. And another common cause for hallucinations is input context. And this is one we can do something directly about as users. Now, here, context refers to the information that is given to the model as an input prompt. Context can help guide the model to produce the relevant and accurate outputs, but it can also confuse or mislead the model if it's unclear or if it's inconsistent or if it's contradictory. So, for example, if I ask an LLM chat bot, \"Can cats speak English?\" I would expect the answer \"No, and do you need to sit down for a moment?\". But perhaps I just forgotten to include a crucial little bit of information, a bit of context that this conversation thread is talking about the Garfield cartoon strip, in which case the LLM should have answered, \"Yes, cats can speak English and that cat is probably going to ask for second helpings of lasagna.\" Context is important, and if we don't tell it we're looking for generated text suitable for an academic essay or a creative writing exercise, we can't expect it to respond within that context. Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can",

                    "maxCueIdx": 63,

Which brings us nicely to the third and final part-- what can we do to reduce hallucinations in our own conversations with LLMs? So, yep, one thing we can certainly do is provide clear and specific prompts to the system. Now, the more precise and the more detailed the input prompt, the more likely the LLM will generate relevant and, most importantly, accurate outputs. So, for example, instead of asking \"What happened in World War Two?\" That's not very clear. It's not very specific. We could say, \"Can you summarize the major events of World War Two, including the key countries involved in the primary causes of the conflict?\" Something like that that really gets at what we are trying to pull from this. That gives the model a better understanding of what information is expected in the response. We can employ something called active mitigation strategies. And what these are are using some of the settings of the LLMs, such as settings that control the parameters of how the LLM works during generation. A good example of that is the temperature parameter, which can control the randomness of the output. So a lower temperature will produce more conservative and focused responses, while a higher temperature will generate more diverse and creative ones. But the higher the temperature, the more opportunity for hallucination. And then one more is multi-shot prompting. And in contrast to single shot prompting where we only gave one prompt, multi-shot prompting provides the LLM with multiple examples of the desired output format or context, and that essentially primes the model, giving a clearer understanding of the user's expectations. By presenting the LLM with several examples, we help it recognize the pattern or the context more effectively, and this can be particularly useful in tasks that",

So, generating code, writing poetry or answering questions in a specific style. So while large language models may sometimes hallucinate and take us on an unexpected journey, 54 million kilometers off target, understanding the causes and employing the strategies to minimize those causes really allows us to harness the true potential of these models and reduce hallucinations.

                "content": " Over the past couple of months, large language models, or LLMs, such as chatGPT, have taken the world by storm. Whether it's writing poetry or helping plan your upcoming vacation, we are seeing a step change in the performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. My name is Kate Soule. I'm a senior manager of business strategy at IBM Research, and today I'm going to give a brief overview of this new field of AI that's emerging and how it can be used in a business setting to drive value. Now, large language models are actually a part of a different class of models called foundation models. Now, the term \"foundation models\" was actually first coined by a team from Stanford when they saw that the field of AI was converging to a new paradigm. Where before AI applications were being built by training, maybe a library of different AI models, where each AI model was trained on very task-specific data to perform very specific task. They predicted that we were going to start moving to a new paradigm, where we would have a foundational capability, or a foundation model, that would drive all of these same use cases and applications. So the same exact applications that we were envisioning before with conventional AI, and the same model could drive any number of additional applications. The point is that this model could be transferred to any number of tasks. What gives this model the super power to be able to transfer to multiple different tasks and perform multiple different functions is that it's been trained on a huge amount, in an unsupervised manner, on unstructured data. And what that means, in the language domain, is basically I'll feed a bunch of sentences-- and I'm talking terabytes of data here --to train this model. And the start of my sentence might be \"no use crying over spilled\" and the end of my sentence might be \"milk\". And I'm trying to get my model to predict the last word of the sentence based off of the words that it saw before. And it's this generative capability of the model-- predicting and generating the next word --based off of previous words that it's seen beforehand, that is why that foundation models are actually",

And it's this generative capability of the model-- predicting and generating the next word --based off of previous words that it's seen beforehand, that is why that foundation models are actually a part of the field of AI called generative AI because we're generating something new in this case, the next word in a sentence. And even though these models are trained to perform, at its core, a generation past, predicting the next word in the sentence, we actually can take these models, and if you introduce a small amount of labeled data to the equation, you can tune them to perform traditional NLP tasks-- things like classification, or named-entity recognition --things that you don't normally associate as being a generative-based model or capability. And this process is called tuning. Where you can tune your foundation model by introducing a small amount of data, you update the parameters of your model and now perform a very specific natural language task. If you don't have data, or have only very few data points, you can still take these foundation models and they actually work very well in low-labeled data domains. And in a process called prompting or prompt engineering, you can apply these models for some of those same exact tasks. So an example of prompting a model to perform a classification task might be you could give a model a sentence and then ask it a question: Does this sentence have a positive sentiment or negative sentiment? The model's going to try and finish generating words in that sentence, and the next natural word in that sentence would be the answer to your classification problem, which would respond either positive or negative, depending on where it estimated the sentiment of the sentence would be. And these models work surprisingly well when applied to these new settings and domains. Now, this is a lot of where the advantages of foundation models come into play. So if we talk about the advantages, the chief advantage is the performance. These models have seen so much data. Again,",

So if we talk about the advantages, the chief advantage is the performance. These models have seen so much data. Again, data with a capital D-- terabytes of data --that by the time that they're applied to small tasks, they can drastically outperform a model that was only trained on just a few data points. The second advantage of these models are the productivity gains. So just like I said earlier, through prompting or tuning, you need far less label data to get to task-specific model than if you had to start from scratch because your model is taking advantage of all the unlabeled data that it saw in its pre-training when we created this generative task. With these advantages, there are also some disadvantages that are important to keep in mind. And the first of those is the compute cost. So that penalty for having this model see so much data is that they're very expensive to train, making it difficult for smaller enterprises to train a foundation model on their own. They're also expensive-- by the time they get to a huge size, a couple billion parameters --they're also very expensive to run inference. You might require multiple GPUs at a time just to host these models and run inference, making them a more costly method than traditional approaches. The second disadvantage of these models is on the trustworthiness side. So just like data is a huge advantage for these models, they've seen so much unstructured data, it also comes at a cost, especially in the domain like language. A lot of these models are trained basically off of language data that's been scraped from the Internet. And there's so much data that these models have been trained on. Even if you had a whole team of human annotators, you wouldn't be able to go through and actually vet every single data point to make sure that it wasn't biased and didn't contain hate speech or other toxic information. And that's just assuming",

And that's just assuming you actually know what the data is. Often we don't even know-- for a lot of these open source models that have been posted --what the exact datasets are that these models have been trained on leading to trustworthiness issues. So IBM recognizes the huge potential of these technologies. But my partners in IBM Research are working on multiple different innovations to try and improve also the efficiency of these models and the trustworthiness and reliability of these models to make them more relevant in a business setting. All of these examples that I've talked through so far have just been on the language side. But the reality is, there are a lot of other domains that foundation models can be applied towards. Famously, we've seen foundation models for vision --looking at models such as DALL-E 2, which takes text data, and that's then used to generate a custom image. We've seen models for code with products like Copilot that can help complete code as it's being authored. And IBM's innovating across all of these domains. So whether it's language models that we're building into products like Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery, vision models that we're building into products like Maximo Visual Inspection, or Ansible code models that we're building with our partners at Red Hat under Project Wisdom. We're innovating across all of these domains and more. We're working on chemistry. So, for example, we just published and released molformer, which is a foundation model to promote molecule discovery or different targeted therapeutics. And we're working on models for climate change, building Earth Science Foundation models using geospatial data to improve climate research. I hope you found this video both informative and helpful.

A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out, and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened, (Laughter) and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime, the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet, in real terms, adjusted for inflation, has tripled. Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two-thirds. Per-capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled. How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not? How did we achieve that? How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous? The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population, and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita. I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine, to meet and, indeed, to mate.

They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting. It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. The differences are what interest me, because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years -- from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago. Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations. Of course there were a few changes, but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. There was no progress, no innovation. It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true. Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. And there's another difference too, which is the object on the left is made from one substance. The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances, from silicon and metal and plastic and so on. And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas, the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser, the idea of transistors. They've all been combined together in this technology. ",

And it's this combination, this cumulative technology, that intrigues me, because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells. They've come together. How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things? Well, it uses sexual reproduction. In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures, a green one and a red one, then one has to be better than the other. One goes extinct for the other to survive. But if you have a sexual species, then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages. So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. It's not confined to its own lineage. What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution? And I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchanging one thing for another. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals -- But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

As Adam Smith said, \"No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.\" (Laughter) You can have culture without exchange. You can have, as it were, asexual culture. Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture. They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. But the difference is that these cultures never expand, never grow, never accumulate, never become combinatorial, and the reason is because there is no sex, as it were, there is no exchange of ideas. Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops. There's no exchange of ideas between them. And why does exchange raise living standards? Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817. And here is a Stone Age version of his story, although he told it in terms of trade between countries. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe. Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. He doesn't need Adam. He can make his own spears and axes. Well no, because if you think about it, if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, then they will each have saved an hour of work.

So the gains from trade are only going to grow. And this is one of the beauties of exchange, is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization, which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on. Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time. That is prosperity, the saving of time in satisfying your needs. Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside. You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it. You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc. How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time. How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today? And the answer is about half a second. Back in 1950, you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light. And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950, as it were, because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else, or you can acquire another good or service.

And back in 1880, it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in 1800, you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In other words, the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800. Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse, and ask yourself: \"Who made them and for who?\" The stone axe was made by someone for himself. It was self-sufficiency. We call that poverty these days. But the object on the right was made for me by other people. How many other people? Tens? Hundreds? Thousands? You know, I think it's probably millions. Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee, which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig, who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc. They were all working for me, to make a mouse for me. And that's the way society works. That's what we've achieved as a species. In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you.

But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures, he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too. They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris, and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had. And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other. We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards. Now, you do get other animals working for each other too. Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers. But there's a big difference, which is that it only happens within the colony. There's no working for each other across the colonies. And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor. That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction. The queen does it all. In our species, we don't like doing that. It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction. (Laughter) Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.

But I've got no evidence for that. It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. In all hunter-gatherer societies today, there's a foraging division of labor between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females. It isn't always quite that simple, but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. The woman knows that, in the Hadzas' case here -- digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat -- she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat. And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog. And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots. All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some. And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this. They were a highly cooperative species. They were a highly intelligent species.

They buried their dead. They had language, probably, because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us, which was discovered here in Oxford. And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals. But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females. It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups, because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains, the tools they made, are always made from local materials. For example, in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. They're always made from local chert. In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date, 30,000 years ago, and some of those are from local chert, but more -- but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away. And when human beings began moving objects around like this, it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. Trade is 10 times as old as farming. People forget that.

And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa, when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. You also see seashells -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria. And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. And that will have led to specialization. How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration? Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals, who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa, which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs, and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia. So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration. What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize? And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse. An example is Tasmania. When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago, the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland, they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing ",

When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago, the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland, they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island. How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years? It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego -- similar island, similar people. The reason: because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight, and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years. The Tasmanians were isolated. Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it. In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it. But who knows how to make a computer mouse? Nobody, literally nobody. There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse. I mean this quite seriously. The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know. He just knows how to run a company. The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on. We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.

I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s, called \"I, Pencil\" in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made, and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil, because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite, and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. And what we've done in human society, through exchange and specialization, is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's not the same with language. With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. But with technology, we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It's completely irrelevant. What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they're cooperating, not how clever the individuals are. So we've created something called the collective brain. We're just the nodes in the network. We're the neurons in this brain. It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress, incrementally, bit by bit. However, bad things happen. ",

And in the future, as we go forward, we will, of course, experience terrible things. There will be wars; there will be depressions; there will be natural disasters. Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making, and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before, I'm also sure that technology will advance, and therefore living standards will advance. Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it? Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward. A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- \"These days even instant gratification takes too long.\" (Laughter) And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do? No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial. We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk. And of course, we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too.

So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it. I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at. But there's a very serious point, and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives -- on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life. And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness. You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, \"I can't take it anymore,\" and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them.

And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn\'t slow down -- you know, I\'d be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat." I\'d be -- you know, I\'d be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called "The One-Minute Bedtime Story." And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say, "Hallelujah -- what a great idea! This is exactly what I\'m looking for to speed up bedtime even more." But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this? Am I really in such a hurry that I\'m prepared to fob off',

I just thought, and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. And I had two questions in my head. The first was, how did we get so fast? And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology. But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures, time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West, time is linear. It's a finite resource; it's always draining away. You either use it, or lose it. \"Time is money,\" as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically ID:",

Well -- well, we speed up, don't we? We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset? And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best. Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: they're slowing down, and finding that, although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, the opposite turns out to be true: that by slowing down at the right moments, people find that they do everything better. They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better. And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the \"International Slow Movement.\" Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement.

If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space. And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned ",

And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, which tend to tap into sort of slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing. Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them. Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there? I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there. I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, \"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds.\" So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now, you know, I like a quickie as much as the next person, but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.

And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. The workplace. Right across much of the world -- North America being a notable exception -- working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France -- too much, too soon, too rigid.

And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too. I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me to write to their parents, to help them slow down, to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill.

But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, \"What are you -- you know, our kids will fall\" -- the headmaster said, \"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day.\" And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don't know how to dream.

And so what these Ivy League schools, and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard, for instance, they send out a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, if they put on the brakes, if they do less, but give time to things, the time that things need, to enjoy them, to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think -- \"Slow Down!\" -- with an exclamation mark on the end. So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it? I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. (Laughter) But why is it so hard to slow down? I think there are various reasons.

I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. It\'s all that adrenaline rush. It\'s hard to give it up. I think there\'s a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, so that we don\'t have to ask, am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right? Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf? Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we\'ve erected against slowing down. "Slow" is a dirty word in our culture. It\'s a byword for "lazy," "slacker," for being somebody who gives up. You know, "he\'s a bit slow." It\'s actually synonymous with being stupid. I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow." You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, that\'s really bad slow. But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too. And good slow is, you know, taking the time ',

Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets.

I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise. (Laughter) And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.

And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, \"You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.\" And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.

I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, and my son came down the stairs and he\'d made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He\'d gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, and put a sticker of his favorite character, Tintin, on the front. And he said to me, or he handed this to me, and I read it, and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin." And I thought, "Aw, that\'s really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card?" And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world." And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work." Thank you very much.',

When the power ran out, the single row LCD display would dim, and I would run to the window to recharge it with the sun.</p><p>The calculator wasn’t very instrumental in my math learning, though. My 3rd grade math teacher had spent months making us do arithmetic in Roman numerals to reinforce the power of Arabic numerals. Once we got to drill and practice multiplication tables, we were amazed at the speed with which we could do our multiples in Arabic, relative to the Roman number system. We were actually faster at recalling our multiples than we were typing them into the calculator, and so for most of us, the calculator was a novelty, a toy. The most entertaining think about it was typing 1001 to make a Homer Simpson face, or typing 8008 to make the word “BOOB”. Other than that, it was just an occasional tool for doing bigger calculations than we could memorize.</p><p>Of course, calculators became more powerful. By the time I was in middle school, graphing calculators could do far more than arithmetic. They could do any function in math, solve for x, even compute derivatives and integrals.",

This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize <a href="/topics/social-sciences/learning-experience">learning experiences</a>. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.</p></div></div><ul><li><a href="/science/article/pii/S1041608023000171">Previous </a></li><li><a href="/science/article/pii/S1041608023000183">Next </a></li></ul><div><h2>Keywords</h2><p>Large language models</p><p>Artificial intelligence</p><p>Education</p><p>Educational technologies</p></div><div><section><h2>1.

In higher education, concerns have emerged such as students\' misuse of LLMs and degraded education outcomes. To unpack the ethical concerns of LLMs for higher education, we conducted a case study consisting of stakeholder interviews (n=20) in higher education computer science. We found that students use several distinct mental models to interact with LLMs - LLMs serve as a tool for (a) writing, (b) coding, and (c) information retrieval, which differ somewhat in ethical considerations. Students and teachers brought up ethical issues that directly impact them, such as inaccurate LLM responses, hallucinations, biases, privacy leakage, and academic integrity issues. Participants emphasized the necessity of guidance and rules for the use of LLMs in higher education, including teaching digital literacy, rethinking education, and having cautious and contextual policies. We reflect on the ethical challenges and propose solutions. <h2>Submission history</h2><p> From: Zhixuan Zhou [<a href="http://arxiv.org/show-email/49cdf6db/2401.12453">view email</a>] <br/> <strong>[v1]</strong>',

These models, which are trained on massive amounts of text data, have the ability to generate or print human-like text and have been used in a variety of applications. What enables them to be so impressive? — Transformers. As conceived by Vaswani et al., transformers are able to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data like natural language. This is possible because they use self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input when processing it. This means that the model can learn to pay more attention to certain words or phrases in a sentence, which allows it to capture subtle nuances and relationships in the data that other models might miss. Additionally, transformers are able to process input in parallel, which makes them more efficient and faster to train than other models that process input sequentially.  One of the most well-known large language models is GPT-3, developed by OpenAI. GPT-3, an autoregressive decoder LLM, has been praised for its ability to generate text that is difficult to distinguish from text written by a human, and it has been used in a range of applications, from chatbots and machine translation to text summarization and content generation.",

While the bottom third of a class might not be getting much value from a year of education today - the core assumption which we hope we have justified in this article is that a tutor will change this.

The critical issue with this reasoning for education is that it’s the parent who pays, and (mostly) the child who gains. So when parents suffer from a miscalibration of expectations with regard to education, it’s the kids who have to suffer the effects of the “winner take-all” policies.  On the flip side, there are deep economic issues that slow down progress here. Educating a child isn’t cheap, even in the developing world. The World Bank estimates a lower bound of about US $200/child/year, putting the cost of educating the 600 million children out of secondary school at about $120 billion/year.

There are a number of demand side interventions which have shown promising, though prohibitively expensive, outcomes. Student level incentives, information-sharing, as well as cash transfers (for which there are numerous experiments) have all demonstrated significant improvements in learning outcomes.

When optimal, the system will show you a card right when you are on the verge of forgetting it so that, on average, you recall it correctly around 85% of the time. So (at least in theory) all you have to do is to show up every day, have the thing throw questions at you (one at a time), think the answer, check the back of the card for the real solution, and tell the system if you got it right or not. If you fail, the system will schedule it again for early review. If you get it right, it will space out the following review of that item. Space Repetition algorithms rely on the so-called forgetting curve to know when to schedule flashcards for review. The forgetting curve describes the decline of memory retention over time and resembles an exponential decay function: the longer time since the last exposure to an item, the easier it is to forget it. But as we accumulate expositions to an item through reviews, we make it more durable in our long-term memory. This way, the forgetting curve becomes smoother over time.

It concerns the use of machine learning to effectively predict memory retention and provide optimum learning guidance. In the research we conducted an extensive review of earlier work on the subject, testing and comparing different methods to select the most effective one. By leveraging our expert knowledge in spaced repetition worked out over the years as well as massive learning data gathered in the www.SuperMemo.com ecosystem, we were able to accelerate the learning process of our LSTM model, making it even more effective. In a sense, the machine learning-based SuperMemo algorithm is similar to our expert one but utilizes different optimization methods to reach the same goals.

As SuperMemo, we started the research in computer supported repetition optimization (spaced repetition) and published the world’s first computer application using this method. By today, it has over 30 years of history and development behind it. We are proud not only to have initiated the trend that is now followed by all leading educational apps, but also to present another milestone in the development of this method. It concerns the use of machine learning to effectively predict memory retention and provide optimum learning guidance. In the research we conducted an extensive review of earlier work on the subject, testing and comparing different methods to select the most effective one. By leveraging our expert knowledge in spaced repetition worked out over the years as well as massive learning data gathered in the www.SuperMemo.com ecosystem, we were able to accelerate the learning process of our LSTM model, making it even more effective. In a sense, the machine learning-based SuperMemo algorithm is similar to our expert one but utilizes different optimization methods to reach the same goals. Our LSTM model is designed to predict the probability of remembering particular items by a user and to plan optimal review intervals, ultimately minimizing time spent on reviews while maintaining a high level of knowledge retention. We compared the model built this way with other machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression, feedforward neural networks or half-life regression, and found that our LSTM model consistently outperformed the others.",

Since then, several variants of the system have been introduced and some of them are still in active use. Next, for the sake of brevity, we describe one of these variants, which has been recently studied by Reddy et al. (8) and Settles et al. (4). The learner maintains several decks of flashcards, labelled j ∈ Z, each of which is reviewed at exponentially decreasing frequency λj = λ0c j , for some constants c and λ0. Whenever a card i from deck j is reviewed, it is moved to deck j + 1 if it is recalled correctly (i.e., if ri(t) = 1), or else (if ri(t) = 0) it is moved to deck j − 1, as shown in Figure S4. The intuition behind the Leitner system is that cards which belong to a deck with a large index j have been learned (or were easy to learn), i.e., they have a low forgetting rate, and cards which are in lower decks have not been learned yet (or were difficult to learn), i.e., they have a high forgetting rate. Then, the learning strategy of the learner is to select flashcards at random from any deck as long as the reviewing rate for flashcards in each deck j remains λj, i.e., the expected number of flashcards selected for review from deck j in any time interval ∆t is λj × ∆t. Modeling the Leitner system. For ease of exposition, we assume that the number of decks is unbounded both from above and below † , i.e., there are always decks with higher (or lower) rate of review than the current deck.",

(4) in some respects: we consider a word i to be recalled correctly at time t, i.e., ri(t) = 1, if the student answered all the questions containing that word correctly. Otherwise, we assume that the word was not recalled correctly. To rule out that the competitive advantage that Memorize offers with respect to the uniform and the threshold based baselines is a consequence of selection bias due to the item difficulty, we compute the empirical distributions of item difficulties for the treatment (Memorize) and control (uniform and threshold) groups and check whether the allocation of items across the treatment and control groups resemble random assignment. Figure S6 summarizes the results for reviewing sequences with a training period T = 5 ± 0.5 days, which show a striking similarity between distributions across groups. In fact, the treatment group is indistinguishable from both the control groups in terms of item difficulties because their values are within a standardize mean difference (SMD) ‡ of 0.25 standard deviations (9). Similar results are obtained for sequences with a training period T = 3 ± 0.3 and with T = 7 ± 0.7. Finally, we would like to acknowledge that there may be other covariates that influence the performance of a learner such as, e.g., time of the day, amount of stress, amount of sleep or degree of concentration. Unfortunately, we did not have access to measurement about them. In Figure 2, for a more fair comparison across items, we normalized each empirical forgetting rate using the average empirical initial forgetting rate of the corresponding item at the beginning of the observation windown0.",

Spaced repetition is a centuries-old psychological technique for efficient memorization & practice of skills where instead of attempting to memorize by ‘cramming’, memorization can be done far more efficiently by instead spacing out each review, with increasing durations as one learns the item, with the scheduling done by software. Because of the greater efficiency of its slow but steady approach, spaced repetition can scale to memorizing hundreds of thousands of items (while crammed items are almost immediately forgotten) and is especially useful for foreign languages & medical studies.  I review what this technique is useful for, some of the large research literature on it and the testing effect (up to ~2013, primarily), the available software tools and use patterns, and miscellaneous ideas & observations on it.  One of the most fruitful areas of computing is making up for human frailties. They do arithmetic perfectly because we can’t 1 ⁠. They remember terabytes because we’d forget. They make the best calendars, because they always check what there is to do today.

We investigate the analogy between training neural models and findings in psychology about human memory model and develop an efficient and effective algorithm to train neural models. The core part of our algorithm is a cognitively-motivated scheduler according to which training instances and their "reviews" are spaced over time.Our algorithm uses only 34-50% of data per epoch, is 2.9-4.8 times faster than standard training, and outperforms competing state-of-the-art baselines. 1 Deep neural models are known to be computationally expensive to train even with fast hardware (Sutskever et al., 2014;Wu et al., 2016). For example, it takes three weeks to train a deep neural machine translation system on 100 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) (Wu et al., 2016).

Our best RbF algorithm uses 34-50% of training data per epoch while producing similar results to state-of-the-art systems on three tasks, namely sentiment classification, image categorization, and arithmetic addition. 3 It also runs 2.9-4.8 times faster than standard training, and outperforms competing state-of-the-art baselines. Research in psychology describes the following memory model for human learning: the probability that a human recalls a previously-seen item (e.g., the Korean translation of a given English word) depends on the difficulty of the item, delay since last review of the item, and the strength of the human memory. The relation between these indicators and memory retention has the following functional form (Reddy et al., 2016;Ebbinghaus, 1913): Pr(recall) = exp(− dif f iculty × delay strength ).

Exploring these types of weaknesses of language models is anÂ activeÂ areaÂ ofÂ researchÂ in the natural language processingÂ community. Overall, we find that it takes a few tries to get a good sample, with the number of tries depending on how familiar the model is with the context. When prompted with topics that are highly represented in the data (Brexit, Miley Cyrus, Lord of the Rings, and so on), it seems to be capable of generating reasonable samples about 50% of the time. The opposite is also true: on highly technical or esoteric types of content, the model can perform poorly.",

Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.  Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.  Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.  While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”  Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.  While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization.",

WebText Dataset    A new web scrape is created which emphasizes document quality. To do this, only web pages are scraped which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point, all outbound links are scraped from Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma.

Large language models can make this problem accessible to organizations without massive corpori of labeled data. However, transforming this problem into one that a large language model can understand requires diving deep into how these models understand the world. Let’s explore how we could solve this with a large language model and little to no training data. A generative large language models (LLM) is a massive neural network that accepts a string of text and returns a logical continuation or completion of that text. The most powerful and useful modern generative large language models, like ChatGPT, are optimized to follow instructions. This allows them to return structured strings (like json) that other software systems can consume. They are trained on enormous amounts of text data, which gives them the ability to follow very complex instructions. For example, such a model could accept a string like:   Convert the following text to iambic pentameter.",

Let’s now take a look at converting these dialogues to a standard format that simplifies the way messages are generated at inference time.

For instance, the conversation above could take the form:  Below is a dialogue between a human and AI assistant ... Human: Is it possible to imagine a society without law?

However, with RETRO the model is not limited to the data seen during trainingâ it has access to the entire training dataset through the retrieval mechanism. This results in significant performance gains compared to a standard Transformer with the same number of parameters. We show that language modeling improves continuously as we increase the size of the retrieval database, at least up to 2 trillion tokens â 175 full lifetimes of continuous reading. Figure 2: Increasing the size of the retrieval dataset results in large gains in model performance. For each text passage (approximately a paragraph of a document), a nearest-neighbor search is performed which returns similar sequences found in the training database, and their continuation. These sequences help predict the continuation of the input text. The RETRO architecture interleaves regular self-attention at a document level and cross-attention with retrieved neighbors at a finer passage level.

In traditional transformer language models, the benefits of model size and data size are linked: as long as the dataset is large enough, language modeling performance is limited by the size of the model. However, with RETRO the model is not limited to the data seen during trainingâ it has access to the entire training dataset through the retrieval mechanism. This results in significant performance gains compared to a standard Transformer with the same number of parameters. We show that language modeling improves continuously as we increase the size of the retrieval database, at least up to 2 trillion tokens â 175 full lifetimes of continuous reading. Figure 2: Increasing the size of the retrieval dataset results in large gains in model performance. For each text passage (approximately a paragraph of a document), a nearest-neighbor search is performed which returns similar sequences found in the training database, and their continuation. These sequences help predict the continuation of the input text. The RETRO architecture interleaves regular self-attention at a document level and cross-attention with retrieved neighbors at a finer passage level. This results in both more accurate and more factual continuations.",

Prompt engineering is becoming a craft in itself: GitHub-style repositories for successful prompts and prompt playgrounds like Everyprompt have already begun to emerge. Moreover, query-based approaches to use models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT for search have also started sprouting as seen with concepts like GPT-index. These parallel applications are just scraping the surface of what can be unlocked with GPT-N models.  Since GPT-3 is trained on a much larger dataset and has significantly more parameters than GPT-2, it is capable of generating more realistic and diverse text. Given the larger scale of engineering and greater amount of parameters, GPT-3 has a larger context window than GPT-2.

To train ChatGPT using reinforcement learning, the model is presented with a conversational context and a prompt, and it must generate a response. This response is then evaluated by a human evaluator, who assigns a score based on its quality. The model’s response is then compared to the responses produced by human conversationalists, and the model is rewarded for generating responses that are similar to the human responses. Over time, this reinforcement learning process allows the model to improve its ability to generate high-quality responses to conversational prompts.

Along the way, the LAM may keep an eye out for signs that other stakeholders may need to be looped in. For example, a customer showing signs of frustration or hesitation may be deemed an “at risk” account, and be referred to a customer service specialist focusing specifically on satisfaction retention.

And many LAMs—all, eventually—will be designed to learn from their experiences, whether it’s gathering more and more expertise in solving an organizational problem, or growing increasingly personalized to the needs and preferences of individual users. And who’s to say LAMs will operate individually? One can just as easily imagine multiple LAMs working together, each optimized for a different set of goals, with another LAM dedicated to the task of orchestrating their efforts and communicating with their user or users, be it an individual, a team, or even an entire organization. In other words, it’d constitute an upgrade from a single personal assistant to an entire team, all unified by a “chief of staff” reporting to the human in charge.

We carefully studied the process of each team, hour by hour. Many teams followed widely accepted rapid prototyping best practices, developing a clearly defined idea first and then quickly creating a prototype to bring that idea to life. To develop their idea, these teams started with the familiar brainstorming discussions, whiteboard sketches, and a joint team effort to agree upon the desired prototype’s specific materials, mechanisms, and measurements. They simply pushed to do all of that much faster. Once they reached clarity on the desired product design, they quickly divided up the work and used the accelerating technologies to create their prototype. These teams were well organized and synchronized. And yet, at the end of the 72 hours, they were unable to produce functional devices and were deeply frustrated.  The teams that were able to create a working product in only 72 hours used the same accelerating technologies, but in a different way.

What should organizations do? Our short answer: Do not use accelerating technologies only for rapid prototyping; use them much earlier and differently, for rapid ideating.  In recent years, a new group of “accelerating technologies” such as 3D printers and Arduino and Raspberry Pi electronics have helped to significantly speed product development. 3D printing is used to quickly produce physical objects using layering methods guided by digital input files, and it has revolutionized the ability to prototype. Developers use tiny, affordable single-board Arduino and Raspberry Pi computers to build a wide variety of applications and devices. These technologies have largely been put to work at the rapid prototyping stage.1 But a study we conducted on accelerating innovation reveals that they provide even more accelerating power when teams use them differently and much earlier, for ideation.  The latest insights on strategy and execution in the workplace, delivered to your inbox once a month. We conducted an in-depth field study of accelerating innovation for assistive technologies in maker spaces in the U.S. (with Lior Zalmanson of Tel Aviv University).2 In our study, teams aimed to solve real-world assistive technology challenges, such as how to operate an elevator with voice or how to enable hearing-impaired individuals to “see” sounds in order to safely cross streets. This kind of innovation usually takes weeks or months, but these teams had just 72 hours to build new, working products and hand them over to anticipating users.",

To Fly, You Need Pilots In a large organization, Agile pilots are necessary in order to determine whether Agile will work there and whether the organization will accept Agile principles. Pilots are critical to a company’s making the necessary adaptations to Agile. For example, in a scrum, a single product owner takes responsibility for managing the relationship and interactions between developers and customers. This role requires a careful mix of technical and business skills. Companies may need to have even two or three people collectively serving in that role until the organization develops people who have the required multifunctional skills. Likewise, it might be difficult to fully implement iterative development in all instances, but frequent feedback between developers and business executives ought to be the norm. Staged rollouts in waves create momentum by building relevant capabilities and ensure that Agile principles and culture are embedded across the organization. The pilot phase is followed by steps that must be executed with some delicacy to avoid unnecessary tension: it’s time to scale up Agile in an organization that may be theoretically willing to accept it but, practically, is challenged to do so.",

Many companies, for example, create teams consisting of the leaders of each Agile project, and they share best practices. At its heart, Agile is about creating the right context in which your people—specifically your developers—can do their best work.

The other significant adjustment was around roles. Prototype idea generators and subject matter experts often have other commitments preventing them from working as a product owner.

According to several other industry reports and surveys, they’re not the only ones who feel that way. Everyone in the technology industry — from software developers to executive leadership — recognizes that there is a significant innovation problem. With over 5 million apps available for download between the Apple App Store and Google Play, implementing innovation strategies into your business model is more important than ever. It may seem obvious, but companies that innovate are more successful than their competitors because users look for apps that stand out and provide increased functionality that aligns with the constantly evolving market. This poses the question – if tech leaders and engineers aren’t allocating time to innovation, what are they spending time on? Lacking Time and Resources  According to a report by Stripe and Harris Poll, developers allocate 17 hours a week (approximately 42% of their time) on tasks such as bad code, debugging, and software updates.
