    Open Recommender - An open source, LLM-powered YouTube video recommendation system
</h1>

<h3 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress... ‚ö†Ô∏è</h3>
The current focus is on building out the data pipeline for searching and downloading YouTube videos and transcripts. The next step will be to build out the recommendation system itself.

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to Open Recommender, an open source recommendation system for YouTube.

## üèÜ Goals

- Understand your current interests by analyzing your Twitter engagement (likes, retweets, etc.)
- Create a large database of potentially interesting videos
- Recommend interesting sections from videos
- Recommend "timeless" content
- Surface "niche bangers" - difficult to find but really high quality content
- Biased towards learning as opposed to entertainment

## How to Run

### Installation

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd open-recommender`
- `npm i`
- Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values

### Commands

- `npm run test-prompts <optional prompt name>` to test the AI prompts (see `aiTests.ts`)
- `npm run yt:search <query>` to test YouTube search
- `npm run yt:transcript <optional videoId>` to test downloading and parsing YouTube transcripts
- `npm run yt:queries <optional user context>` to create a list of YouTube queries based on a user's context
- `npm run main <optional user context>` to run the full data pipeline

## üìö How it Works

A summary of the data pipeline:

- Create a list of search queries to find interesting YouTube videos based on a user's Twitter engagement
- Search YouTube
- Filter videos based on how relevant they are to the user's context
- Download transcripts and chunk them into smaller sections with metadata
- Create a database of video chunks
- Give recommendations to the user based on a mixture of their current and past interests
