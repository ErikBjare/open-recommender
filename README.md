## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to Open Recommender, an open source recommendation system for YouTube.

## üèÜ Goals

- Understand your current interests by analyzing your Twitter engagement (likes, retweets, etc.)
- Create a large database of potentially interesting videos
- Recommend interesting sections from videos
- Recommend "timeless" content
- Surface "niche bangers" - difficult to find but really high quality content
- Biased towards learning as opposed to entertainment

## How to Run

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd open-recommender`
- `npm i`

## üìö How it Works
