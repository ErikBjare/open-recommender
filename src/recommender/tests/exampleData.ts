      "Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain chip company, is getting interest from thousands of prospective volunteer patients for its first human trials.  Ana Kasparian and Wosny Lambre discuss on The Young Turks. \n\nBecome an American hero: https://go.tyt.com/jointyt \n\nGet the Progressive battle plan: https://go.tyt.com/book-description \n\nWatch TYT LIVE on weekdays 6-8 pm ET. http://youtube.com/theyoungturks/live\n\nRead more HERE: https://interestingengineering.com/science/neuralink-elon-musks-brain-chip-human-trial\n\n\"After receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct human trials, thousands of prospective patients have shown interest in being guinea pigs for Neuralink, wrote Ashlee Vance for Bloomberg. Vance also wrote a biography on Elon Musk in 2015.\n\nThe FDA had initially rejected the company’s request to run human trials back in 2022, citing safety concerns. \n\nThe clinical trial involves implanting electrodes and super thin wires into a patient's brain and requires that a part of the skull be removed to insert a computer the size of a quarter. This implant aims to read and analyze the person's brain activity and transmit this information wirelessly to a nearby device like a laptop or tablet.\"\n\n*** \n\nThe largest online progressive news show in the world.
