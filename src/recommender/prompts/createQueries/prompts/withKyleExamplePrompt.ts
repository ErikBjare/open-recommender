i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people.
will have more to say about whatâ€™s next later.

No inside info on the latest events, but knowing Sam personally he was one of the people I trusted most with the world changing technology OpenAI is developing. Bummed out by this, but wish the best for both OpenAI and Sam.

JUST IN: The new CEO of OpenAI, Emmett Shear, will quit if the OpenAI board can't provide evidence of why they fired Sam Altman.

Microsoftâ€™s new 13B Orca 2 outperforms 70B models on many evals.
Interesting synthetic instruct data:
1) try many detailed system prompts
2) generate answers using best prompt for each task
3) replace with generic system prompt in tuning demonstrations https://t.co/5n7kZflQGG

At Microsoft, weâ€™re expanding AI capabilities by training small language models to achieve the kind of enhanced reasoning and comprehension typically found only in much larger models. https://t.co/v67aumSQQX

On Saturday we shipped comparative evals to all our users! We use GPT-4 to compare outputs head to head and calculate a win rate for each model.
In a surprising twist, I've found multiple customer test sets where GPT-4 prefers fine-tuned Mistral to its own outputs! ðŸ‘€

If you were 100% reliant on OpenAI you need to start  exploring open source models TODAY â€“ These are some of my favorite resources and applications. Links below. Who else am I missing?

GPT-4 does a great job with this. It consistently returns the summarized version as requested. Models like Mistral fine-tuned on GPT-4 also do great. But GPT-4-Turbo seems to consistently ignore the instructions to return the shortened version! ðŸ¤” https://t.co/Lgm4ei3mP5

@vkhosla A tractor+combine can do 80% of the job that 80% of humans were doing pre-industrial-revolution. An AI that does 80% of 80% of jobs would be similarly transformational, but not sure it necessarily has to be AGI.

OpenHermes 2.5 is now on @lmsysorg's ChatBot Arena! Go and test out several models and compare them blind to determine who is the best!
